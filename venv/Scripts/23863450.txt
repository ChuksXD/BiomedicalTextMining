AB  - Rational design and develop of targeted contrast agents binding to cancer-related
      proteins will achieve more accurate cancer diagnosis and prognosis by magnetic
      resonance (MR) imaging. CREKA is a tumor-homing pentapeptide
      (Cys-Arg-Glu-Lys-Ala) specifically homes to fibrin-fibronectin complexes
      abundantly expressed in tumor microenvironment. In this study, we developed and
      evaluated a CREKA peptide targeted multiplexed Gd-MR probe (CREKA-Tris-Gd(DOTA)3)
      for MR imaging of breast tumors. CREKA and azide bearing Gd(III) was attached to 
      a maleimide-functional trialkyne scaffold via thiol-maleimide and azide-alkyne
      click chemistry, respectively. CREKA-Tris-Gd(DOTA)3 has a well-defined structure 
      with a molecular weight of 2914 Da. The T1 relaxivity of CREKA-Tris-Gd(DOTA)3 is 
      8.06 mM(-1) s(-1) per Gd (24.18 mM(-1) s(-1) per molecule) at room temperature
      and 3 T. Fluorescence imaging showed high binding specificity of CREKA to a 4T1
      breast tumor model in mice while it was not found for the scrambled CREKA
      (CERAK). The CREKA peptide-targeted contrast agent resulted in greater contrast
      enhancement than the corresponding CERAK agent and the commercialized contrast
      agent ProHance((R)) in tumor at a dose of 0.1 mmol Gd/kg in female athymic mice
      bearing 4T1 breast carcinoma xenograft. This small molecular contrast agent was
      easily excreted from body after imaging indicated low toxicity. The targeted MRI 
      contrast agent has a potential for specific cancer molecular imaging with MRI.
