		Detection Rate of Intra-abdominal Small Intestinal Neuroendocrine Tumor Lesions.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) are the most common
		form of neoplasm in the small bowel. Radiological identification of primary
		"tumors (PT), which may be multiple, is difficult, and therefore palpation of the"
		entire small bowel is routinely performed during laparotomy. The aim was to
		determine detection rates of PT and peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) with
		(68)Ga-DOTATOC/TATE-PET/CT in comparison with i.v. contrast-enhanced computed
		tomography (CE-CT) and thus to clarify whether modern functional imaging can
		mitigate the need for palpation of bowel during surgery enabling oncologically
		adequate laparoscopic resection. METHODS: A total of 28 patients with SI-NET who
		preoperatively underwent both (68)Ga-DOTATOC/TATE-PET/CT and CE-CT were included.
		The detection rates of PT and PC for PET/CT and CE-CT were compared to the
		findings in the surgical and histopathological reports. Appropriate statistical
		"tests were used, and significance was set to p < 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 82 PT, 43"
		PT were not detected by any imaging modality. More PT lesions were detected with
		"PET/CT (n = 39 [47.5%]) than with CE-CT (n = 10 [12.2%], p < 0.001). Also, PET/CT"
		"identified significantly more PC lesions than CE-CT (78 and 38%, p = 0.004,"
		respectively). CONCLUSION: PET/CT detected more PT and PC lesions than CE-CT.
		"Some PTs and PC lesions were only detected by one of the modalities, and CT"
		performed in conjunction with PET/CT should therefore be performed as a fully
		diagnostic CE-CT for optimal results. Palpation of the small bowel remains
		crucial during surgery in these patients because several PTs escaped detection by
		both PET/CT and CE-CT.
