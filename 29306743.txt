AB  - Sieve elements (SEs) degrade selected organelles and cytoplasmic structures when 
      they differentiate. According to classical investigations, only smooth ER,
      mitochondria, sieve element plastids, and, in most cases, P-proteins remain in
      mature SEs. More recent proteomics and immuno-histochemical studies, however,
      suggested that additional components including a protein-synthesizing machinery
      and a fully developed actin cytoskeleton operate in mature SEs. These
      interpretations are at odds with conventional imaging studies. Here we discuss
      potential causes for these discrepancies, concluding that differentiating SEs may
      play a role by 'contaminating' phloem exudates.
