AB  - Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNAs (of about 22 
      nucleotides), which play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation
      of gene expression via either mRNA cleavage or translation inhibition. Several
      machine learning-based approaches have been developed to identify novel miRNAs
      from next generation sequencing (NGS) data. Typically, precursor/genomic
      sequences are required as references for most methods. However, the
      non-availability of genomic sequences is often a limitation in miRNA discovery in
      non-model plants. A systematic approach to determine novel miRNAs without
      reference sequences is thus necessary. Results: In this study, an effective
      method was developed to identify miRNAs from non-model plants based only on NGS
      datasets. The miRNA prediction model was trained with several duplex
      structure-related features of mature miRNAs and their passenger strands using a
      support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The accuracy of the independent test
      reached 96.61% and 93.04% for dicots (Arabidopsis) and monocots (rice),
      respectively. Furthermore, true small RNA sequencing data from orchids was tested
      in this study. Twenty-one predicted orchid miRNAs were selected and
      experimentally validated. Significantly, eighteen of them were confirmed in the
      qRT-PCR experiment. This novel approach was also compiled as a user-friendly
      program called microRPM (microRNA Prediction Model). Availability: This resource
