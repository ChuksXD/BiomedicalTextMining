AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycoheterotrophic plants are one of the most difficult plant groups
      to conserve because they are entirely dependent on symbiotic fungi. Establishment
      of viable culture systems would greatly aid their conservation. We describe a
      simple culture system for the mycoheterotrophic orchid, Gastrodia pubilabiata,
      that does not require laboratory facilities. The orchid is symbiotic with
      leaf-litter-decomposing fungi. RESULTS: Gastrodia pubilabiata seeds were
      incubated in plastic boxes or glass bottles filled with leaf litter collected
      from the natural habitat of the species. Seed germination was observed after 35
      days and seedling development followed. Fungal isolates from seedlings were
      identified as Mycenaceae (Basidiomycota), a leaf-litter-decomposing mycorrhizal
      fungus of Gastrodia species. CONCLUSION: Our method can be used to conserve
      endangered mycoheterotrophic plants associated with leaf litter-decomposing fungi
      efficiently, and can also serve as a model system for physiological and molecular
      studies of such plants.
