AB  - Driving under the influence (DUI) is dangerous and costly, yet there are few
      prospective studies on modifiable risk and protective processes that would inform
      prevention. Middle adolescence, when most individuals are first learning to drive
      and first using alcohol, may be a particularly salient period for family and
      friendship influences on DUI risk. In the present study, youth's family and
      friendship environments were observed and measured at age 16 in a diverse
      community sample (n=999), and then court records were used to document arrest for
      DUI through the age of 32years. We first examined the univariate effects of
      family and friendship variables on later DUI and then fit more comprehensive
      structural equation models to test predictive effects on the level of construct
      (e.g., parental monitoring) and environment (e.g., family). Results indicate that
      parental monitoring (Odds Ratio [OR]=0.77), positive family relations (OR=0.84), 
      prosocial peer affiliation (OR=0.77), and deviant peer affiliation (OR=1.43) at
      age 16 were individually predictive of arrests for DUI from ages 16 to 32, even
      after controlling for both teen and parent alcohol use. The comprehensive,
      multivariate models indicated that the friendship environment was most predictive
      of arrests for DUI during the follow-up period. Together, these results are
      consistent with a model in which attenuated family ties contribute to
      substance-use-based friendships at age 16, which in turn contribute to an
      increased likelihood of arrest for DUI in later adolescence and early adulthood. 
      Implications for prevention are discussed.
