TI  - Protective effects of polyphenol-rich infusions from carob (Ceratonia siliqua)
      leaves and cladodes of Opuntia ficus-indica against inflammation associated with 
      diet-induced obesity and DSS-induced colitis in Swiss mice.

AB  - In the present study, we have investigated the effects of polyphenol-rich
      infusions from carob leaves and OFI-cladodes on inflammation associated with
      obesity and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis in Swiss
      mice. In vitro studies revealed that aqueous extracts of carob leaves and
      OFI-cladodes exhibited anti-inflammatory properties marked by the inhibition of
      IL-6, TNF-alpha and nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells concomitant with NF-kappabeta nucleus
      translocation inhibition. For in vivo investigations, Swiss male mice were
      subjected to control or high fat diet (HFD). At the 8th week after the start of
      study, animals received or not 1% infusion of either carob leaves or OFI-cladode 
      for 4 weeks and were subjected to 2% DSS administration in drinking water over
      last 7 days. After sacrifice, pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in plasma and
      their mRNA expression in different organs were determined. Results showed that
      carob leaf and OFI-cladode infusions reduced inflammation severity associated
      with HFD-induced obesity and DSS-induced acute colitis indicated by decrease in
      pro-inflammatory cytokines expression (as such TNF-alpha, IL1b and IL-6) in
      colon, adipose tissue and spleen. In addition, plasma levels of IL-6 and
      TNF-alpha were also curtailed in response to infusions treatment. Thus, carob
      leaf and OFI-cladode infusions prevented intestinal permeability through the
      restoration of tight junction proteins (Zo1, occludins) and immune homeostasis.
      Hence, the anti-inflammatory effect of carob leaves and OFI-cladodes could be
      attributed to their polyphenols which might alleviate inflammation severity
      associated with obesity and colitis.

TI  - In vivo evidence for homo- and heterodimeric interactions of Arabidopsis thaliana
      dehydrins AtCOR47, AtERD10, and AtRAB18.

AB  - Dehydrins (DHNs) are intrinsically disordered proteins that play central roles in
      plant abiotic stress responses; however, how they work remains unclear. Herein,
      we report the in planta subcellular localization of Arabidopsis thaliana DHNs
      AtCOR47, AtERD10, and AtRAB18 through GFP translational fusions. To explore the
      dimerization ability of the Arabidopsis acidic DHNs AtCOR47 and AtERD10, we
      conducted an in planta DHN binding assay using the Bimolecular Fluorescence
      Complementation (BiFC) technique. Our analyses revealed homodimeric interactions 
      for AtCOR47 and AtERD10; interestingly, heterodimeric associations also occurred 
      with these DHNs, and these interactions were observed in the cytosol of tobacco
      cells. Furthermore, we evaluated whether Arabidopsis basic DHNs, such as AtRAB18,
      could also interact with itself and/or with AtCOR47 and AtERD10 in the BiFC
      system. Our data revealed homodimeric RAB18 complexes in the nucleus and cytosol,
      while heterodimeric associations between AtRAB18 and acidic DHNs occurred only in
      the cytosol. Finally, we demonstrated the presence of heterodimeric complexes
      among Arabidopsis AtCOR47, AtERD10, and AtRAB18 DHNs with their acidic ortholog
      the OpsDHN1 from Opuntia streptacantha; these heterodimeric interactions showed
      different subcellular distributions. Our results guide DHN research toward a new 
      scenario where DHN/DHN oligomerization could be explored as a part of their
      molecular mechanism.

TI  - Hydrocarbon Degradation and Lead Solubility in a Soil Polluted with Lead and Used
      Motor Oil Treated by Composting and Phytoremediation.
LID - 10.1007/s00128-017-2211-6 [doi]
AB  - Used lubricant oils and metals can be common soil pollutants in abandoned sites. 
      When soil is contaminated with various hazardous wastes, the efficiency of
      biological treatments could be affected. The purpose of this work was to
      investigate the effect of combining phytoremediation and composting on the
      efficiency of hydrocarbon degradation and lead solubility in a soil contaminated 
      with 31,823 mg/kg of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) from used motor oil and
      8260 mg/kg of lead. Mexican cactus (Opuntia ficus indica) and yard trimmings were
      added in the composting process, and lucerne (Medicago sativa) was used in the
      phytoremediation process. After a 9 week composting process, only 13% of the
      initial TPH concentration was removed. The following 20 week phytoremediation
      process removed 48% of TPH. The highest TPH degradation percentage (66%), was
      observed in the experiment with phytoremediation only. This work demonstrates
      sustainable technologies, such as biological treatments, represent low-cost
      options for remediation; however, they are not frequently used because they
      require long periods of time for success.

AB  - The optimization of enzymatic hydrolysis, with high solids loading, of two
      species of cactus pear for bioethanol production was tested evaluating the
      influence of surfactant Tween 80 and pretreatment with H2O and H2SO4 (1%v/v) (50 
      degrees C, 150rpm, 3h). XRD and FTIR analyzes were performed. Afterwards, the
      influence of the factors cellulase (FPUg(-1)), pectinase (Ug(-1)) and solids load
      (%w/v), on the hydrolysis of varieties (50 degrees C, 150rpm, 48h), and the
      fermentation of the optimal point (33 degrees C, 8h) were evaluated. The
      pretreatments and the Tween 80 did not increase the hydrolysis yields and
      Rotacional Central Compound Design indicated that the pectinase factor was not
      significant. The best cellulase and solids load conditions were 10FPUg(-1) of
      biomass and 30%w/v for both species. The fermentation efficiency of hydrolysates 
      for Nopalea cochenillifera and Opuntia ficus-indica were 76.3% and 82.8%,
      respectively, showing their potential for bioethanol production.

      Gastric Emptying and Small-Bowel Motility in Rat.
LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.13990 [doi]
AB  - This study was conducted to compare the effects of juice and seeds on gastric
      emptying, small-bowel motility and intestinal ion transport. Separate groups of
      rats were randomized to receive NaCl, increasing doses of juice (5, 10, and 20
      mL/kg, b.w.) or seeds aqueous extract (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, b.w.).
      Simultaneously, two other groups were received, the reference drugs; clonidine (1
      mg/kg) and yohimbine (2 mg/kg). The charcoal meal was used as a suspension for
      gastrointestinal motility test. The purgative action of juice was confirmed using
      the loperamide (5 mg/kg, p.o.) induced constipation. To evaluate the
      antisecretory effect, we were used as a hypersecretion agent, the castor oil at
      the dose of 5 mL/kg. Compared to the control and standard groups, we were showed 
      that the prickly pear has an opposite effect on small-bowel motility and gastric 
      emptying. Indeed, the juice at various doses has a laxative effect of
      gastrointestinal transit in healthy and constipated-rats. However, the aqueous
      extract of the seeds leads to a reduction of motility in normal rats which gives 
      it a remarkable antidiarrhoeal activity, a notable intestinal fluid accumulation 
      decline and electrolyte concentrations reestablishment. Moreover, orally juice
      administered at different doses accelerated the stomach emptying time in contrast
      to the seeds aqueous extract. More importantly, a significant variation in the
      phytochemical constituents levels between juice and seeds was found. These
      findings confirm the reverse therapeutic effects of this fruit in the treatment
      of digestive disturbances such as difficulty stool evacuation and massive
      intestinal secretion, likewise, the gastric emptying process perturbation.

AB  - Asthma is a chronic pulmonary disease that affects an estimated 235 million
      people worldwide, but asthma drugs have many adverse effects. Opuntia humifusa
      (eastern prickly pear) has been used as a food and traditional medicine
      worldwide; however, its anti-asthmatic effects have not been reported. We
      evaluated O. humifusa as a potential therapeutic or preventive component of
      anti-asthmatic drugs. We divided ovalbumin-sensitized mice into the following
      groups: normal control, asthma-induced control, dexamethasone-treated group
      (positive control), 50 mg/kg O. humifusa-treated group, 100 mg/kg O.
      humifusa-treated group, and 500 mg/kg O. humifusa-treated group. Levels of
      Th1/Th2/Th17-related cytokines were evaluated using RT-PCR, ELISA, and
      immunohistochemistry. O. humifusa dose-dependently suppressed the morphological
      changes typically observed in asthma, such as goblet cell hyperplasia,
      inflammatory cell infiltration, mucous hypersecretion, and relative basement
      membrane thickening in the respiratory system. These results may be attributable 
      to regulation of Th1-/Th2-/Th17-related factors, especially interleukin (IL)-4
      and IL-13. We conclude that O. humifusa is a potential anti-asthmatic functional 
      food. Abbreviations: O. humifusa: Opuntia humifusa; Th: helper T; RT-PCR:

LID - 10.4103/pm.pm_495_16 [doi]
AB  - Background: Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) (L.) Mill. (Cactaceae), a plant widespread
      in dry regions of the world, shows interesting biological activities
      (cicatrizant, antiulcer, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipidemic) and is widely used
      in traditional medicine. Objectives: Phytochemical analysis and antispasmodic
      effect of wild OFI cladodes were carried out. Material and Methods: Polyphenols
      and Vitamin E occurrence, in antioxidant pool of OFI cladodes, were quantified by
      high-performance liquid chromatography. The antispasmodic effect of OFI cladodes 
      was assessed in isolated rabbit smooth muscle tissues. The experiments were
      carried out with preparations of rabbit jejunum and uterus with the spontaneous
      contractile activity, to evaluate the effect of cumulative concentrations of the 
      extract on basal tone, amplitude, and frequency of contractions. Results:
      Catechin, quercetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin and chlorogenic, ferulic, and
      p-coumaric acid were identified. alpha-, beta-, and gamma-tocopherols have been
      highlighted and alpha-tocopherol is the major component. OFI cladodes contain
      significant amount of polyphenols and tocopherols that are effective radical
      scavengers and inhibited ethanol 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl formation by 50%. 
      OFI cladodes caused a light inhibition of amplitude and frequency of spontaneous 
      contractions and a marked decrease in muscle basal tone of rabbit jejunum
      preparations. On spontaneously contracting uterus preparations, the addition of
      increasing concentrations of cladode extract caused uterine muscle relaxation.
      Conclusion: The contraction of smooth muscle preparations depends on an increase 
      in cytoplasmic free calcium ion concentration, which activates the contractile
      elements. The flavonoids may suppress the contractility of smooth myocytes, by an
      inhibition of availability of Ca(2+) for muscle contraction. SUMMARY: Opuntia
      ficus-indica (OFI) cladodes contain significant amount of polyphenols and
      tocopherols that are effective radical scavengers and inhibited ethanol
      1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl formation by 50%Polyphenols and Vitamin E complex
      occurrence in OFI cladodes were characterized by high-performance liquid
      chromatographyOFI cladodes exhibited significative antispasmodic activity. The
      antispasmodic effect was assessed in isolated rabbit smooth muscle tissues. The
      experiments were carried out with preparations of rabbit jejunum and uterus with 
      the spontaneous contractile activity, to evaluate the effect of cumulative
      concentrations of the extract on basal tone, amplitude, and frequency of

TI  - Effect of three pretreatment techniques on the chemical composition and on the
      methane yields of Opuntia ficus-indica (prickly pear) biomass.
PG  - 17-29
LID - 10.1177/0734242X17741193 [doi]
AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) is an emerging biomass that has the potential to be
      used as substrate in anaerobic digestion. The goal of this work was to
      investigate the effect of three pretreatment techniques (thermal, alkaline,
      acidic) on the chemical composition and the methane yield of OFI biomass. A
      composite experimental design with three factors and two to three levels was
      implemented, and regression modelling was employed using a total of 10
      biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests. The measured methane yields ranged
      from 289 to 604 NmL/gVSadded; according to the results, only the acidic
      pretreatment (HCl) was found to significantly increase methane generation.
      However, as the experimental values were quite high with regards to the
      theoretical methane yield of the substrate, this effect still needs to be
      confirmed via further research. The alkaline pretreatment (NaOH) did not
      noticeably affect methane yields (an average reduction of 8% was recorded),
      despite the fact that it did significantly reduce the lignin content. Thermal
      pretreatment had no effect on the methane yields or the chemical composition.
      Scanning electron microscopy images revealed changes in the chemical structure
      after the addition of NaOH and HCl. Modelling of the cumulated methane production
      by the Gompertz modified equation was successful and aided in understanding
      kinetic advantages linked to some of the pretreatments. For example, the alkaline
      treatment (at the 20% dosage) at room temperature resulted to a mumax (maximum
      specific methane production rate [NmLCH4/(gVSadded.d)]) equal to 36.3 against
      18.6 for the control.

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica L. is known for its beneficial effects on human health, but 
      still little is known on cladodes as a potent source of antioxidants. Here, a
      direct, economic and safe method was set up to obtain water extracts from Opuntia
      ficus-indica cladodes rich in antioxidant compounds. When human keratinocytes
      were pre-treated with the extract before being exposed to UVA radiations, a clear
      protective effect against UVA-induced stress was evidenced, as indicated by the
      inhibition of stress-induced processes, such as free radicals production, lipid
      peroxidation and GSH depletion. Moreover, a clear protective effect against
      apoptosis in pre-treated irradiated cells was evidenced. We found that eucomic
      and piscidic acids were responsible for the anti-oxidative stress action of
      cladode extract. In conclusion, a bioactive, safe, low-cost and high value-added 
      extract from Opuntia cladodes was obtained to be used for skin health/protection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diuretic, hypotensive and renal effect of Opuntia
      ficus-indica in two different species in oral and intravenous administration.
      METHODS: Diuretic activity was evaluated in rats with the plant cladode gel and
      aqueous extract administrated orally, and was evaluated in rabbits with plant
      extract administered intravenously. Single and repeated doses of cladode gel or
      aqueous extract of cladode were tested. Urine volume and blood and urine
      creatinine, sodium and potassium were measured, and creatinine clearance was
      calculated. The hypotensive effect of lyophilized extract of cladode was
      evaluated in rabbits. Two polyethylene PE50 catheters were used: one in the
      jugular vein for the infusion of the plant extract and the other in the carotid
      for the evaluation of the arterial pressure. RESULTS: The cladode gel or aqueous 
      extract increased urine volume, creatinine clearance and urinary excretion of
      sodium and potassium without significant effect on serum creatinine or blood
      urea. Furosemide, gel and aqueous extract of cladode insignificantly lowered
      plasma potassium in rats. Intravenous administration of the lyophilized extract
      caused a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure in rabbits with a
      significant increase in urine volume and urine sodium and potassium; the effect
      was dose dependent. Intravenous administration of lyophilized extract did not
      affect plasma sodium or potassium. CONCLUSIONS: Gel and aqueous extract of
      Opuntia ficus-indica cladode have a significant diuretic effect on rats, and the 
      lyophilized extract has a diuretic and hypotensive effect on normotensive rabbits
      without deterioration in renal function test. Additional studies on active
      ingredients are essential to pave the way for clinical studies on diuretic and
      hypotensive effect of the plant.

AB  - Opuntia plants grow naturally in areas where temperatures are extreme and highly 
      variable in the day during the entire year. These plants survive through
      different adaptations to respond to adverse environmental conditions. Despite
      this capability, it is unknown how CAM photosynthetic activity and growth in
      Opuntia plantlets is affected by constant heat or cold. Therefore, the main
      objective of this research was to evaluate the short-term effect of high (40
      degrees C) and low (4 degrees C) continuous temperatures on the photosynthetic
      efficiency, the organic acid content (malic acid) and the relative growth rate
      (RGR) in seven-month-old Opuntia streptacantha plantlets during 5, 10, and 15
      days. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis allowed us to determine that high
      temperatures negatively impact the photosynthetic efficiency of O. streptacantha 
      plantlets, which exhibited the lowest values of maximum quantum efficiency of the
      photosystem II (Fv/Fm = 52%, Fv/F0 = 85%), operational quantum yield of PS
      (PhiPSII = 65%) and relative electron transport rate (rETR = 65%), as well as
      highest values of basal fluorescence (F0 = 226%) during 15 days of treatment.
      Similarly, low temperatures decreased Fv/Fm (16%), Fv/F0 (50%), PhiPSII and rETR 
      (16%). High temperatures also decreased nocturnal acidification in approximately 
      34-50%, whereas low temperatures increased it by 30-36%. Additionally, both
      continuous temperatures affected drastically diurnal consumption of malic acid,
      which was related to a significant RGR inhibition, where the specific
      photosynthetic structure area component was the most affected. Our results
      allowed determining that, despite the high tolerance to extreme temperatures
      described for Opuntia plants, young individuals of O. streptacantha suffered
      photosynthetic impairment that led to the inhibition of their growth. Thus, the
      main findings reported in this study can help to predict the potential impact of 
      climatic change on the establishment and survival of succulent species of arid
      and semiarid regions of Mexico.

AB  - Industrial pollutants such as heavy metals and hydrocarbons in soils represent a 
      serious concern due to their persistence and negative effects on the environment,
      affecting cellular processes in living organisms and even causing mutations and
      cancer. The main objectives of this work were to evaluate the efficiency of
      Opuntia ficus in the phytoremediation of a soil polluted with used motor oil. Two
      other species, one with different and one with similar characteristics,
      relatively, were used for comparison purposes: Lolium perenne and Aloe
      barbadensis. The effect of the plants on lead solubility and bioaccumulation, the
      biomass production of each specie and the microbial counts and bacterial
      identification for each experiment was studied. Total petroleum hydrocarbons
      (TPH) were measured every 5 weeks throughout the 20-week phytoremediation
      experiment. At the end of the experiment soluble Pb, Pb extracted by the plant
      species, microbiological counts, total biomass and bacterial species in soil were
      analyzed. Even though Lolium perenne showed the highest TPH removal (47%),
      Opuntia ficus produced the highest biomass and similar removal (46%). Since
      Opuntia ficus requires low amounts of water and grows fast, it would be a
      suitable option in the remediation of soils polluted with hydrocarbons and/or
      heavy metals.

TI  - Improved method for genomic DNA extraction for Opuntia Mill. (Cactaceae).
PG  - 82
LID - 10.1186/s13007-017-0234-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomic DNA extracted from species of Cactaceae is often contaminated
      with significant amounts of mucilage and pectin. Pectin is one of the main
      components of cellular walls, whereas mucilage is a complex polysaccharide with a
      ramified structure. Thus, pectin- and mucilage-free extraction of DNA is a key
      step for further downstream PCR-based analyses. RESULTS: We tested our DNA
      extraction method on cladode tissue (juvenile, adult, and herbaria exemplars) of 
      17 species of Opuntia Mill., which are characterized by a large quantity of
      pectin and mucilage. CONCLUSION: We developed a method for the extraction of gDNA
      free of inhibitory compounds common in species of Opuntia Mill., such as pectin
      and mucilage. Compared to previously extraction protocols, our method produced
      higher yields of high-quality genomic DNA.

TI  - Cactus Opuntia as natural flocculant for urban wastewater treatment.
PG  - 1875-1883
LID - 10.2166/wst.2017.370 [doi]
AB  - The cactus tree, species Opuntia ficus-indica, is a primary material of many
      products in various domains such as cosmetics, medicine and nutrition. In the
      present work, we assess its potential as a flocculant. We tried a technique which
      adopts three sequential treatments that used coagulation, flocculation and
      sedimentation processes under certain operating conditions. For this purpose, we 
      used the aluminum sulfate (AS) as coagulant and fresh cladodes juice (FCJ) as
      bioflocculant. All tests were carried out on high turbid urban wastewater
      collected from the Metlaoui's Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWTP) (in Gafsa in
      southwest Tunisia). Experiments with this couple AS/FCJ show very interesting
      results: a high-removal of turbidity (TUR), suspended solids (SS) and chemical
      oxygen demand (COD). The percentages of abatement of these parameters are
      respectively 93.65%, 82.75% and 64.30%. The experimental results of the present
      study prove that the turbidity, SS and COD removal efficiency of new technique is
      superior to that of conventional process (with only AS). By this technique, we
      save 50% in AS dose. Moreover, flocs formed by the treatment using AS/FCJ are
      coarse and readily settleable.

AB  - There is evidence that support the clinical usage of glycemic index (GI) and
      glycemic load (GL) in the prevention of chronic disease. Objective: To determine 
      the GI and GL of the Opuntia ficus-indica fruit. Methodology: An analytic,
      transversal study was made involving 25 healthy volunteers accepted by an
      informed consent with a normal body mass index, glucose, glycoside hemoglobin,
      cholesterol and serum triglycerides. The homogeneity of the population was
      evaluated with anthropometrical and biochemical data using principal component
      analysis (PCA). The equivalent of 50 g of carbohydrates test food (tuna) and 50 g
      of dextrose as food standard was provided for the measure of the glucose curve.
      The GI was determined by calculating the area under the curve by the
      triangulation method. The CG was reported as the product of IG by carbohydrate
      loading provided. Results and Conclusions: The IG of the tuna was 48.01 +/- 17.4,
      classified as low, while the CG was 24.0 +/- 8.7 rated as high. The chemometric
      analysis by PCA showed that the selection of the normal population for
      determining the IG, it is important to consider the values of cholesterol and
      triglycerides.

AB  - The aim of this study is to isolate pectin from peel (WNPE) and pulp (WNPU) of
      Opuntia microdasys var. rufida's (OMR) cladodes and to characterize these
      polysaccharides by size exclusion (SEC/MALS/VD/DRI), gas chromatography coupled
      to mass spectrometer (GC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR), and Fourier 
      transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The polysaccharides were
      extracted in neutral aqueous media followed by ethanol precipitation and
      dialysis. Both WNPE and WNPU are mainly composed of uronic acids and some neutral
      sugars such as arabinose, galactose, rhamnose and mannose. Their molecular weight
      range from 2,180,000 and 4,920,000g/mol. The in-vivo pharmacological activities
      (anti-inflammatory, analgesic and gastroprotective activities) have been
      performed. The extracted pectin (50-100mg/kg, i.p. (intraperitoneal)) inhibited, 
      in a dose-related manner, both carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats and
      Xylene-induced ear edema in mice. A dose-dependent action was obtained against
      chemical (writhing test) and thermic (hot plate test) stimuli, respectively, with
      doses of 50 and 100mg/kg. Moreover, a considerable gastroprotective effect was
      observed with these two biopolymers, the gastric ulcer was attenuated until
      67.67% for WNPE and 81.93% for WNPU, at the dose of 100mg/kg.

AB  - In this study, pectin was isolated from Opuntia ficus indica (OFI) cladodes after
      removing mucilage using the xylanase and cellulase. The process variables were
      optimized by the Box Behnken design with three factors at three levels. The
      optimal extraction condition obtained was: liquid to solid (LS), cellulase to
      xylanase and enzymes to matter ratios of 22ml/g, 2:1U/U and 4U/g, respectively.
      The simulated extraction yield of 17.91% was validated by the experimental result
      (16.67+/-0.30). The enzyme-extracted pectin from OFI cladodes (EAEPC) was low
      methylated, with a high uronic acid content, a water and oil holding capacity of 
      5.42g/g and 1.23g/g, respectively, a good foam and emulsion stability and
      important DPPH radical scavenging activity. Both the OFI cladodes and enzymatic
      process present promising alternatives to traditional sources and extraction
      processes of pectin, respectively. EAEPC thus represents a promising additive in 
      food industries.

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes are a potential source of solid biofuel from
      marginal, dry land. Experiments assessed the effects of temperature (180-250
      degrees C), reaction time (0.5-3h) and biomass to water ratio (B/W; 0.07-0.30) on
      chars produced via hydrothermal carbonization. Multivariate linear regression
      demonstrated that the three process parameters are critically important to
      hydrochar solid yield, while B/W drives energy yield. Heating value increased
      together with temperature and reaction time and was maximized at intermediate B/W
      (0.14-0.20). Microscopy shows evidence of secondary char formed at higher
      temperatures and B/W ratios. X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric data,
      microscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry suggest that calcium 
      oxalate in the raw biomass remains in the hydrochar; at higher temperatures, the 
      mineral decomposes into CO2 and may catalyze char/tar decomposition.

AB  - The impact of cooking methods (boiling, microwaving, griddling and frying in
      olive and soybean oils) on nutritional composition (protein, minerals, fat,
      carbohydrates, fibre, fatty acid profile and energy), antioxidant capacity and
      (poly)phenolic compounds of cactus cladodes (Opuntia ficus-indica) was evaluated.
      Culinary processes, except boiling, increased soluble and insoluble fibre up to
      5.0g/100g becoming a good fibre source. Cactus cladodes fried in olive oil showed
      a healthier fatty acid profile and lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio than in soybean
      oil. Flavonoids accounted for 80% of total (poly)phenolic compounds, being
      isorhamnetin the most abundant. Heat treatment, particularly griddling and
      microwaving, increased every flavonoid and phenolic acid up to 3.2-fold higher
      than in raw samples, and consequently their antioxidant capacity. Even boiling
      induced losses in total (poly)phenols and antioxidant capacity by leaching into
      water, the main compounds were maintained. Principal Component Analysis
      distributed heat treated cactus cladodes according to their distinctive
      polyphenols and antioxidant capacity.

AB  - Phytochemical investigation of the thalli of ethyl acetate-methanol extract of
      the red seaweed Gracilaria opuntia led to isolation of a substituted 2H-chromen
      derivative of unusual structure possessing highly oxygenated carbon skeleton,
      characterised as
      2-acetoxy-2-(5-acetoxy-4-methyl-2-oxotetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)ethyl
      4-(3-methoxy-2-(methoxymethyl)-7-methyl-3,4,4a,7,8,8a-hexahydro-2H-chromen-4-ylox
      y)-5-methylheptanoate, which have not been reported in nature. The chemical
      structure was resolved by detailed spectroscopic analysis. The anti-inflammatory 
      activity of the newly reported metabolite was determined by pro-inflammatory
      cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory assays. The anti-inflammatory
      selectivity index of the title compound recorded greater value (SI:
      anti-cycloxygense-[Formula: see text]/anti-cycloxygense-[Formula: see text] ~
      1.26) than synthetic NSAIDs (aspirin and ibuprofen, SI: 0.02 and 0.44,
      respectively), and consequently, appeared to be safer. The antioxidative activity
      of the title compound was significantly greater as determined by 2,
      2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2, 2'-azino-bis
      (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radical scavenging activities (IC50
      0.26-0.32 mg/mL) compared to alpha-tocopherol (IC50 > 0.6 mg/mL), and was
      comparable to the synthetic antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene and butylated
      hydroxyanisole (IC50 ~ 0.25-0.34 mg/mL).

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the effect of the Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon dactylon L. 
      Pers) replacement by Orelha de Elefante Mexicana spineless cactus (Opuntia
      stricta [Haw.] Haw) on the nutrient intake and digestibility, growth performance,
      microbial protein synthesis, and efficiency of dietary nitrogen compound
      utilization in the diets of Girolando heifers. Twenty-four (3.5 months and 100 kg
      +/- 3.5 kg) Girolando heifers (5/8 Holstein x Gyr) were used and arranged in a
      completely randomized design. Dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, and
      neutral detergent fiber decreased linearly as a function of the levels of Tifton 
      hay (TH) replacement by Orelha de Elefante Mexicana spineless cactus (OEM). The
      non-fiber carbohydrate intake and coefficient of dry matter digestibility
      increased, while the neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility decreased
      linearly with the OEM inclusion. After evaluating the growth performance by
      observing weight gain and morphometric measurements, there were no significant
      alterations. The urinary volume, nitrogen balance as well as the efficiency of
      nitrogen retention had increased, while the urinary and plasma urea
      concentrations had decreased linearly with the OEM inclusion. The results
      obtained in this study show that Orelha de Elefante Mexicana spineless cactus
      should replace Tifton hay in post-weaned heifer diets.

AB  - Consumer interest in the use of natural ingredients is creating a growing trend
      in the food industry, leading to research into the development of natural
      products such as colorants, antimicrobials and antioxidant compounds. This work
      involves an extensive morphological (using physico-chemical assays), chemical
      (antioxidant activity assays) and microbiological (Gram-positive and negative
      strains) characterization of prickly peras (Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) var.
      sanguigna, gialla and Opuntia engelmannii) fruits. Through chromatographic
      assays, these species have shown interesting contents of hydrophilic (sugars,
      organic acids and betalains) and lipophilic (tocopherols and fatty acids)
      compounds. While Opuntia engelmannii exhibited higher content of betacyanins and 
      mucilage, OFI varieties sanguigna and gialla displayed greater organic acid
      content. The sanguigna variety also showed the highest alpha-tocopherol content. 
      All this compounds could be the responsible of enhancing the bioactivity of this 
      variety, which can be observed in its antimicrobial potential, tested in the
      studied strains too. Results revealed that Opuntia spp. could be used as a
      nutraceutical and/or food additive, maintaining and promoting health and life
      quality.

AB  - Bioactive compounds, such as isorhamnetin and piscidic acid, were obtained from
      decoctions of cladodes (stem pads from Opuntia ficus-indica). The effect of these
      phenolic compounds, in a fiber-free extract, were evaluated as inhibitors of
      cholesterol permeation through a Caco-2 cell monolayer and as
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor. A reduction of 38% in 
      cholesterol permeation through the Caco-2 cell monolayer was obtained, and the
      phenolic compounds all permeated between 6 and 9%. A mixture of these compounds
      showed an IC50 of 20.3 mug/mL as an enzyme inhibitor, whereas piscidic acid alone
      showed an IC50 of 149.6 mug/mL; this was slightly outperformed by the
      isorhamnetin derivatives. Docking studies confirmed that both piscidic acid and
      isorhamnetin derivatives, present in the decoction, could adequately bind to the 
      enzyme active site. These results reveal that O. ficus-indica, and cladodes
      derived there from, is a promising plant for use in the development of new
      functional foods and pharmaceutical products.

TI  - Crystallization and Colloidal Stabilization of Ca(OH)2 in the Presence of Nopal
      Juice (Opuntia ficus indica): Implications in Architectural Heritage
      Conservation.
PG  - 10936-10950
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b02423 [doi]
AB  - Hydrated lime (Ca(OH)2) is a vernacular art and building material produced
      following slaking of CaO in water. If excess water is used, a slurry, called lime
      putty, forms, which has been the preferred craftsman selection for formulating
      lime mortars since Roman times. A variety of natural additives were traditionally
      added to the lime putty to improve its quality. The mucilaginous juice extracted 
      from nopal cladodes has been and still is used as additive incorporated in the
      slaking water for formulation of lime mortars and plasters, both in ancient
      Mesoamerica and in the USA Southwest. Little is known on the ultimate effects of 
      this additive on the crystallization and microstructure of hydrated lime. Here,
      we show that significant changes in habit and size of portlandite crystals occur 
      following slaking in the presence of nopal juice as well as compositionally
      similar citrus pectin. Both additives contain polysaccharides made up of
      galacturonic acid and neutral sugar residues. The carboxyl (and hydroxyl)
      functional groups present in these residues and in their alkaline degradation
      byproducts, which are deprotonated at the high pH (12.4) produced during lime
      slaking, strongly interact with newly formed Ca(OH)2 crystals acting in two ways:
      (a) as nucleation inhibitors, promoting the formation of nanosized crystals, and 
      (b) as habit modifiers, favoring the development of planar habit following their 
      adsorption onto positively charged (0001)Ca(OH)2 faces. Adsorption of
      polysaccharides on Ca(OH)2 crystals prevents the development of large particles, 
      resulting in a very reactive, nanosized portlandite slurry. It also promotes
      steric stabilization, which limits aggregation, thus enhancing the colloidal
      nature of the lime putty. Overall, these effects are very favorable for the
      preparation of highly plastic lime mortars with enhanced properties.

TI  - Cross-Cultural Analysis of Medicinal Plants commonly used in Ethnoveterinary
      Practices at South Waziristan Agency and Bajaur Agency, Federally Administrated
      Tribal Areas (FATA), Pakistan.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In remote areas, medicinal plants have an
      imperative role in curing various livestock's ailments. In Pakistan, people
      residing in remote areas including South Waziristan Agency and Bajaur Agency
      depend on traditional herbal remedies for treating their domestic animals.
      Medicinal plants are an important part of the medical system in these Agencies.
      The prime goal of the current study is to explore the ethnoveterinary practices
      in the two regions and discuss cross-cultural consensus on the use of medicinal
      plants. In this study, we have given detailed description on the ethnoveterinary 
      usage of certain medicinal plants and their recipes. Moreover, we have also
      elaborated the ethnoveterinary potential of certain plants in relation to their
      ethnomedicinal, pharmacological and phytochemicals reports. METHODOLOGY:
      Fieldwork comprised of two fields surveys conducted at South Waziristan Agency
      and Bajaur Agency. A total of 75 informants from South Waziristan Agency and 80
      informants from Bajaur Agency were interviewed with the help of semi-structured
      questionnaires. Use reports (URs) were recorded for all the documented taxa. Data
      were quantitatively analyzed by using informant consensus factor (Fic) index in
      order to find out information homogeneity provided by the informants. To analyze 
      the cross-cultural consensus, the recorded data were tabulated as well as shown
      by Venn diagram. RESULTS: Overall, 94 medicinal plant taxa were recorded in the
      comparative analysis. Out of these, most of the plants species (72 species) were 
      used at Bajaur Agency than South Waziristan Agency (37 species). Cross-cultural
      analysis showed that only 15 medicinal plants were used in common by the
      indigenous communities in both Agencies, which indicates a low interregional
      consensus with regard to the ethnoveterinary practices of medicinal plants.
      Apiaceae was the dominant family in both regions by representing maximum number
      of plant species (11 species). Gastro intestinal complexities were common in both
      regions having higher Fic values (above 90). Moreover, the current investigation 
      reported new ethnoveterinary uses of medicinal plants from South Waziristan
      Agency, which were Sideroxylon mascatense, Raphanus sativus, Salix babylonica,
      Solanum nigrum, Sophora mollis, Taraxacum campylodes and Tulipa stellata. On the 
      other hand from Bajaur Agency, Boerhavia erecta, Celtis australis, Chamaecyparis 
      obtusa var. obtuse, Eryngium biehersteinianum, Gossypium arboreum, Narcissus
      tazetta, Opuntia littoralis, Streblus asper were reported with new
      ethnoveterinary uses. CONCLUSIONS: The current study has an important
      contribution towards the preservation of indigenous plants' based knowledge.
      Several plants are carrying important ethnoveterinary uses being practiced by the
      local people mostly against the gastrointestinal disorders in both regions.
      Importantly, the cross-cultural approach has reported some new traditional uses
      of plants against livestock's diseases. Hence, this is an opportunity to
      investigate such plants phytopharmacologically and toxicologically for the
      discovery of new drug sources.

TI  - The influence of herbivory and weather on the vital rates of two closely related 
      cactus species.
PG  - 6996-7009
LID - 10.1002/ece3.3232 [doi]
AB  - Herbivory has long been recognized as a significant driver of plant population
      dynamics, yet its effects along environmental gradients are unclear.
      Understanding how weather modulates plant-insect interactions can be particularly
      important for predicting the consequences of exotic insect invasions, and an
      explicit consideration of weather may help explain why the impact can vary
      greatly across space and time. We surveyed two native prickly pear cactus species
      (genus Opuntia) in the Florida panhandle, USA, and their specialist insect
      herbivores (the invasive South American cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum, and
      three native insect species) for five years across six sites. We used generalized
      linear mixed models to assess the impact of herbivory and weather on plant
      relative growth rate (RGR) and sexual reproduction, and we used Fisher's exact
      test to estimate the impact of herbivory on survival. Weather variables
      (precipitation and temperature) were consistently significant predictors of vital
      rate variation for both cactus species, in contrast to the limited and varied
      impacts of insect herbivory. Weather only significantly influenced the impact of 
      herbivory on Opuntia humifusa fruit production. The relationships of RGR and
      fruit production with precipitation suggest that precipitation serves as a cue in
      determining the trade-off in the allocation of resources to growth or fruit
      production. The presence of the native bug explained vital rate variation for
      both cactus species, whereas the invasive moth explained variation only for O.
      stricta. Despite the inconsistent effect of herbivory across vital rates and
      cactus species, almost half of O. stricta plants declined in size, and the
      invasive insect negatively affected RGR and fruit production. Given that fruit
      production was strongly size-dependent, this suggests that O. stricta populations
      at the locations surveyed are transitioning to a size distribution of
      predominantly smaller sizes and with reduced sexual reproduction potential.

TI  - Anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of the methanolic extract of
      Opuntia humifusa stem.
PG  - 366-375
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Opuntia humifusa (O. humifusa) Raf. has been used for the prevention
      and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation, and cancer. Our study was
      designed to unveil the anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of the
      methanolic extract of O. humifusa Raf stem (OHS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      anti-nociceptive effect was measured by hot plate, acetic acid-induced writhing, 
      and tail flick assays in mice and rats. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effect
      was measured by vascular permeability and carrageenan and serotonin-induced paw
      edema tests in rats. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory effect was also measured
      using macrophage-like LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. RESULTS: OHS extract inhibited
      acetic acid-induced writhing (p<0.0001), and delayed the reaction time of mice to
      the hot plate-induced thermal stimulation (p<0.0001) and tail flick tests
      (p<0.05). OHS extract attenuated the carrageenan and serotonin-induced paw edema 
      in rats (p<0.001). Similarly, OHS extract significantly decreased Evans blue
      concentration in acetic acid induced vascular permeability test (p<0.0001),
      revealing its strong anti-inflammatory effect. Finally, among four different
      fractions of OHS extract, n-butanol fraction strongly decreased NO production
      (p<0.0001) and iNOS expression in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. CONCLUSION: Our
      results suggest that the methanolic extract of O. humifusa stem can be used to
      develop a therapeutic or supportive drug and/or functional food against pain and 
      inflammation related diseases.

TI  - INVASIVE ALIEN PLANT SPECIES USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISEASES IN
      LIMPOPO PROVINCE, SOUTH AFRICA.
PG  - 223-231
LID - 10.21010/ajtcam.v13i4.29 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Invasive alien plant species (IAPs) are plants that have migrated
      from one geographical region to non-native region either intentional or
      unintentional. The general view of IAPs in environment is regarded as destructive
      to the ecosystem and they pose threat to native vegetation and species. However, 
      some of these IAPS are utilized by local inhabitants as a substitute for scarce
      indigenous plants. The aim of the study is to conduct ethnobotanical survey on
      medicinal usage of invasive plant species in Waterberg District, Limpopo
      Province, South Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ethnobotanical survey on
      invasive plant species was conducted to distinguish species used for the
      treatment of various ailments in the Waterberg, District in the area dominated by
      Bapedi traditional healers. About thirty Bapedi traditional healers (30) were
      randomly selected via the snowball method. A guided field work by traditional
      healers and a semi-structured questionnaire was used to gather information from
      the traditional healers. The questionnaire was designed to gather information on 
      the local name of plants, plant parts used and methods of preparation which is
      administered by the traditional healers. RESULTS: The study revealed that Schinus
      molle L., Catharanthus roseus (L.), Datura stramonium L., Opuntia stricta (Haw.) 
      Haw., Opuntia ficus- indica, Sambucus canadensis L., Ricinus communis L., Melia
      azedarch L., Argemone ochroleuca and Eriobotrya japonica are used for treatment
      of various diseases such as chest complaint, blood purification, asthma,
      hypertension and infertility. The most plant parts that were used are 57.6%
      leaves, followed by 33.3% roots, and whole plant, seeds and bark at 3% each.
      Noticeably, most of these plants are cultivated (38%), followed by 28% that are
      common to the study area, 20% abundant, 12% wild, and 3% occasionally. Schinus
      molle is the most frequently used plant species for the treatment of various
      ailments in the study area. National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act
      (NEMBA) (10/2004) and Conservation of Agricultural Resource Act (CARA) were
      consulted to confirm the invaders status. Only eight plants (60%) are regulated
      by CARA (10/2004). Of 10 IAPs, 80% (8 species) are listed in both NEMBA and CARA 
      legislation. Only 20% (2 species) are listed in NEMBA alone. CONCLUSION: Invasive
      alien plants are utilized by communities to combat various ailments in humans and
      these plants can help to reduce pressure on heavily harvested indigenous plant.

TI  - Targeting Aging with Functional Food: Pasta with Opuntia Single-Arm Pilot Study.
LID - 10.1089/rej.2017.1992 [doi]
AB  - Interventions to extend life span represent the new perspective in aging
      investigation. Healthy dietary habits are important modifiable factors that can
      favor a healthy aging phenotype. Many studies have demonstrated benefits for
      metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus resulting from the traditional
      Mediterranean foods. Opuntia Ficus Indica (OFI), widespread in the Mediterranean 
      basin, belongs to the Cactaceae family. It is known for its antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, products containing extracts from OFI
      fruits or cladodes have been used to control obesity and other metabolic
      parameters, such as glycemia and lipid profile. The aim of this study was to
      analyze the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of pasta with 3% of OFI
      cladode extracts added to show its beneficial effect in human health. We
      performed a single arm longitudinal intervention study in 42 healthy volunteers, 
      administrating 500 g/week of this functional pasta for 30 days. Our pasta had
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties with putative effect on the aging
      process and related metabolic diseases. We also demonstrated a hypoglycemic
      effect. The results are preliminary, but it is possible to speculate that our
      pasta could be considered an effective food for the prevention of age-related
      metabolic disorders.

TI  - Hepatoprotective Flavonoids in Opuntia ficus-indica Fruits by Reducing Oxidative 
      Stress in Primary Rat Hepatocytes.
PG  - 472-476
LID - 10.4103/pm.pm_232_16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver disorder was associated with alcohol consumption caused by
      hepatic cellular damages. Opuntia ficus-indica fruit extracts (OFIEs), which
      contain betalain pigments and polyphenols including flavonoids, have been
      introduced as reducing hangover symptoms and liver protective activity.
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate hepatoprotective activity of OFIEs and isolated compounds 
      by high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      extract of O. ficus-indica fruits was fractionated into methylene chloride and
      n-butanol. The n-butanol fraction was isolated by HSCCC separation (methylene
      chloride-methanol-n-butanol-water, 5:4:3:5, v/v/v/v). The hepatoprotective
      activity of OFIEs and isolated compounds was evaluated on rat primary hepatocytes
      against ethanol-induced toxicity. Antioxidative parameters such as glutathione
      reductase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) enzymes and the GSH content were
      measured. RESULTS: Two flavonoids, quercetin 3-O-methyl ester (1) and
      (+)-taxifolin, and two flavonoid glycosides, isorhamnetin 3-O-beta-d-glucoside
      (3) and narcissin (4), were isolated from the n-butanol fraction by HSCCC
      separation. Among them, compound 2 significantly protected rat primary
      hepatocytes against ethanol exposure by preserving antioxidative properties of GR
      and GSH-Px. CONCLUSIONS: OFIEs and (+)-taxifolin were suggested to reduce hepatic
      damage by alcoholic oxidative stress. SUMMARY: Hepatoprotective Flavonoids were
      isolated from Opuntia ficus-indica by high -speed countercurrent chromatography
      (HSCCC).

TI  - Antioxidant properties and chemical characterization of Spanish Opuntia
      ficus-indica Mill. cladodes and fruits.
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.8628 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that consumption of Opuntia
      ficus-indica Mill. has an important positive health benefit, mainly due to
      antioxidant properties, which justifies this research. This study examined
      antioxidant activity, organic acid and sugar profile, total phenolic, and
      physicochemical characteristics of six O. ficus-indica cultivars growing in the
      Spanish Mediterranean. It should be noted that, in this study, both cladodes
      (young and adult) and fruits (peel and pulp) were analyzed. RESULTS: The
      antioxidant activity (2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and
      2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl methods) was higher in fruit peel than in cladodes.
      The young cladodes presented an important antioxidant activity by the
      ferric-reducing ability of plasma method as well as a higher total phenolic
      content (18.90 g gallic acid equivalent per kilogram). High-performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) with diode-array detector analysis revealed the absence of 
      sucrose and the presence of glucose and fructose, which the values were higher in
      pulp fruits. HPLC with refractive index detector analysis showed that citric,
      malic, and succinic acids were the main organic acids in all cultivars, with a
      significant higher content in old cladodes. CONCLUSION: These investigations
      valorize O. ficus-indica fruits in comparison with cladodes. In general, this
      plant can be considered as an ingredient for the production of health-promoting
      food, highlighting mainly in the antioxidant activity and total polyphenols
      content found in young cladodes and peel fruits. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical

TI  - Bioaccessibility, Intestinal Permeability and Plasma Stability of Isorhamnetin
      Glycosides from Opuntia ficus-indica (L.).
LID - E1816 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms18081816 [doi]
AB  - Isorhamnetin glycosides are representative compounds of Opuntia ficus-indica that
      possess different biological activities. There is slight information about the
      changes in bioaccessibility induced by the glycosylation pattern of flavonoids,
      particularly for isorhamnetin. In this study, the bioaccessibility and
      permeability of isorhamnetin glycosides extracted from O. ficus-indica were
      contrasted with an isorhamnetin standard. Also, the plasma stability of these
      isorhamnetin glycosides after intravenous administration in rats was evaluated.
      Recoveries of isorhamnetin after oral and gastric digestion were lower than that 
      observed for its glycosides. After intestinal digestion, isorhamnetin glycosides 
      recoveries were reduced to less than 81.0%. The apparent permeability coefficient
      from apical (AP) to basolateral (BL) direction (Papp(AP-BL)) of isorhamnetin was 
      2.6 to 4.6-fold higher than those obtained for its glycosides. Isorhamnetin
      diglycosides showed higher Papp(AP-BL) values than triglycosides. Sugar
      substituents affected the Papp(AP-BL) of the triglycosides. Isorhamnetin
      glycosides were better retained in the circulatory system than the aglycone.
      After intravenous dose of the isorhamnetin standard, the elimination half-life
      was 0.64 h but increased to 1.08 h when the O. ficus-indica extract was
      administered. These results suggest that isorhamnetin glycosides naturally found 
      in O. ficus-indica could be a controlled delivery system to maintain a constant
      plasmatic concentration of this important flavonoid to exert its biological
      effects in vivo.

TI  - Effects of catalase on chloroplast arrangement in Opuntia streptacantha
      chlorenchyma cells under salt stress.
PG  - 8656

AB  - In arid and semiarid regions, low precipitation rates lead to soil salinity
      problems, which may limit plant establishment, growth, and survival. Herein, we
      investigated the NaCl stress effect on chlorophyll fluorescence,
      photosynthetic-pigments, movement and chloroplasts ultrastructure in chlorenchyma
      cells of Opuntia streptacantha cladodes. Cladodes segments were exposed to salt
      stress at 0, 100, 200, and 300 mM NaCl for 8, 16, and 24 h. The results showed
      that salt stress reduced chlorophyll content, F v /F m , PhiPSII, and qP values. 
      Under the highest salt stress treatments, the chloroplasts were densely clumped
      toward the cell center and thylakoid membranes were notably affected. We analyzed
      the effect of exogenous catalase in salt-stressed cladode segments during 8, 16, 
      and 24 h. The catalase application to salt-stressed cladodes counteracted the
      NaCl adverse effects, increasing the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters,
      photosynthetic-pigments, and avoided chloroplast clustering. Our results indicate
      that salt stress triggered the chloroplast clumping and affected the
      photosynthesis in O. streptacantha chlorenchyma cells. The exogenous catalase
      reverted the H2O2 accumulation and clustering of chloroplast, which led to an
      improvement of the photosynthetic efficiency. These data suggest that H2O2
      detoxification by catalase is important to protect the chloroplast, thus
      conserving the photosynthetic activity in O. streptacantha under stress.

AB  - Antioxidant and antihypertensive potential of the sulphated polygalactans
      isolated from the marine macroalgae Kappaphycus alvarezii and Gracilaria opuntia 
      were assessed by utilising different in vitro systems. The galactans isolated
      from K. alvarezii possessed significantly greater antioxidative properties as
      determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH IC90 0.97 mg/mL) and
      2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS(.+) IC90 0.72 mg/mL)
      scavenging activities than those isolated from G. opuntia (DPPH IC90 1.2 mg/mL
      and ABTS 0.86 mg/mL). The sulphated polygalactan
      -->4)-4-O-sulphonato-(2-O-methyl)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)-3,6-anhydro-(2-
      O-methyl)-alpha-D-galactopyranan from K. alvarezii showed greater
      angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity (IC50 0.02 mug/mL) than
      -->3)-4-O-sulphonato-(6-O-acetyl)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)-3,6-anhydro-(2-

      anhydro-(2-O-sulphonato)-alpha-D-galactopyranan motif extracted from G. opuntia
      (IC50 0.70 mug/mL). Structure activity correlation studies displayed that the ACE
      inhibitory properties of titled polygalactans were directly proportional to their
      electronic properties and inversely with the steric and hydrophobic
      characteristics. Putative ACE inhibitory mechanism of action of sulphated
      galactans from marine macroalgae corroborated the structure bioactivity
      correlation analysis.

AB  - Plants with beneficial properties are known in traditional medicine. Nowadays, in
      spite of widespread availability of synthetic compounds, the search goes towards 
      natural compounds to lower cost and few side effects. The increasing interest in 
      preventive medicine encourages use of nutraceuticals, bioactive compounds of
      vegetable origin with important nutritional values. Among the medicinal plants,
      Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller (Family Cactaceae, subfamily Opuntiodeae, Genus 
      Opuntia, subgenus Platyopuntia, species Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller) is
      widely known for its beneficial properties. The aim of the present review is to
      stress the major classes of Opuntia components and their medical interest through
      emphasis on some of their biological effects, particularly those having the most 
      promising expected health benefits and therapeutic impacts on fish and mammals.

LID - 10.3390/molecules22081291 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, biological hydroxyapatite (HA) was obtained from bovine
      bones through a thermal process. A total of 0% and 1% of silver nanoparticles
      (Ag-NPs) synthesized from Opuntia ficus (nopal) were added to the biological
      hydroxyapatite coatings using an atmospheric plasma spray (APS) on a Ti6Al4V
      substrate. Following this, its antimicrobial efficiency was evaluated against the
      following bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This was conducted according to the Japanese Industrial
      Standard (JIS) Z2801:2000 "Antimicrobial Product-Test for Antimicrobial Activity 
      and Efficacy". Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the silver
      nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) were evenly distributed on the coating surface. Energy
      dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) shows that apatite deposition occurs on a
      daily basis, maintaining a Ca/P rate between 2.12 and 1.45. Biocompatibility
      properties were evaluated with osteoblast-like cells (MC3T3-E1) by single-cell
      gel electrophoresis assay and Tali image cytometry.

AB  - Carotenoid profiles of different tissues (peel, pulp and whole fruit) of Spanish 
      Sanguinos (red) and Verdal (orange) prickly pears (Opuntia ficus-indica spp.)
      have been characterized in detail and quantified for the first time. Carotenoids 
      were determined by HPLC-PDA-MS (APCI(+)), using a reverse phase C30 column. A
      total of 9 xantophylls and 4 hydrocarbon carotenes were identified. Also, minor
      amounts of chlorophyll a, a' and b can be observed in Opuntia peel extracts. All 
      carotenoids were found to be present in their free form (no carotenoid esters
      were detected). The RAE was highest in Opuntia peels, showing values from 19.20
      to 16.48microg/100g fresh weigth, for Sanguinos and Verdal Opuntia fruits,
      respectively. The main carotenoid in Opuntia peel extracts was (all-E)-lutein
      with 1132.51 and 767.98microg/100g fresh weigth, followed by
      (all-E)-beta-carotene with 200.40 and 173.50microg/100g fresh weigth for
      Sanguinos and Verdal varieties of Opuntia fruits, respectively.

AB  - Opuntia sp. has long been used as a folk medicine to treat hepatitis and diabetes
      in Sicile (Italy). To extract the polyphenols from the flower of Opuntia
      microdasys Lehm. at post flowring stage and evaluate the antidiabetic activity in
      vitro and in vivo. The hepatoprotective activity of Opuntia microdasys aqueous
      flowers extract at post flowering stage (OFP) has been tested for their
      antidiabetic activity. On fructose-alloxan induced diabete in rat model,
      evaluating the inhibitory effects of OFP on some carbohydrate metabolizing
      enzymes, pancreatic alpha-amylase and intestinal alpha-glucosidase activities in 
      vitro. The OFP extract showed inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase
      (IC50=0.17+/-0.012mg/ml) and alpha-amylase (IC50=2.55+/-0.41mg/ml). The
      inhibitory potential of OFP extract on these enzymes suggests a positive and
      probable role of this extract in the management and treatment of diabetes
      mellitus, particularly, for type 2. Oral administration of the OFP at 200mg/kg to
      diabetic male rats for 28days demonstrated a significant protective effect by
      lowering the levels of glucose (123.21+/-1.38mg/dL) and hepatic marker enzymes
      (AST, ALT, LDH, gamma-GT, BT, PAL, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG). OFP attenuated
      oxidative stress by decreasing the SOD, CAT, GPX activity and the levels of PC
      and MDA in the liver and restored the histological architecture of the rat liver.
      OFP has protective effects on the protection of liver, thereby reducing some of
      the causes of diabetes in experimental animals.

TI  - Bioactivity and chemical characterization of Opuntia macrorhiza Engelm. seed oil:
      potential food and pharmaceutical applications.
PG  - 2739-2747
LID - 10.1039/c7fo00731k [doi]
AB  - In the food industry, there is a continuous search for ingredients that might
      provide advantageous properties to food products, either considering their
      nutritional value or bioactivity, as well as flavouring and technological
      aspects. Crude oils are good examples of this type of ingredient, especially if
      obtained from nonconventional sources. Accordingly, the Opuntia macrorhiza
      Engelm. seed oil (OMSO) was chemically characterized and evaluated for different 
      in vitro and in vivo bioactivities. OMSO presented physicochemical
      characteristics appropriate to be considered as an edible oil, namely low acidity
      value, stability to oxidation (high peroxide value and low K232 and K270 values),
      and high contents of unsaturated fatty acids (as shown by the iodine value) and
      saponifiable matter. Furthermore, this natural oil, owing to its rich
      phytochemical profile, showed relevant antioxidant activity (especially in lipid 
      peroxidation inhibition assays), alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity,
      cytotoxicity against human tumour cell lines, antibacterial (mainly against Gram 
      positive species) and antifungal properties, as well as anti-inflammatory and
      analgesic activities. Furthermore, OMSO did not show any sign of acute toxicity
      on animals, highlighting its possible use in different applications, considering 
      that this natural product is not expected to induce the adverse effects typically
      associated with synthetic bioactive agents (e.g., ampicillin, amphotericin B, or 
      lysine acetylsalicilate).

      Type Two Diabetes.

LID - 10.3389/fphar.2017.00436 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a common effect of uncontrolled high blood sugar and it is
      associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs. In 
      the adult population, the global prevalence of diabetes has nearly doubled since 
      1980. Without effective prevention and management programs, the continuing
      significant rise in diabetes will have grave consequences on the health and
      lifespan of the world population, and also on the world economy. Supplements can 
      be used to correct nutritional deficiencies or to maintain an adequate intake of 
      certain nutrients. These are often used as treatments for diabetes, sometimes
      because they have lower costs, or are more accessible or "natural" compared to
      prescribed medications. Several vitamins, minerals, botanicals, and secondary
      metabolites have been reported to elicit beneficial effects in hypoglycemic
      actions in vivo and in vitro; however, the data remain conflicting. Many
      pharmaceuticals commonly used today are structurally derived from natural
      compounds from traditional medicinal plants. Botanicals that are most frequently 
      used to help manage blood glucose include: bitter melon (Momordica charantia),
      fenugreek (Trigonella foenum graecum), gurmar (Gymnema sylvestre), ivy gourd
      (Coccinia indica), nopal (Opuntia spp.), ginseng, Russian tarragon (Artemisia
      dracunculus), cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia), psyllium (Plantago ovata), and garlic
      (Allium sativum). In majority of the herbal products and secondary metabolites
      used in treating diabetes, the mechanisms of action involve regulation of insulin
      signaling pathways, translocation of GLUT-4 receptor and/or activation the
      PPARgamma. Several flavonoids inhibit glucose absorption by inhibiting intestinal
      alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase. In-depth studies to validate the efficacies 
      and safeties of extracts of these traditional medicinal plants are needed, and
      large, well designed, clinical studies need to be carried out before the use of
      such preparations can be recommended for treatment and/or prevention of diabetes.
      The main focus of this review is to describe what we know to date of the active
      compounds in these, along with their glucose-lowering mechanisms, which are
      either through insulin-mimicking activity or enhanced glucose uptake.

PG  - 2465-2469
LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.002012 [doi]
AB  - Three strains representing a novel species of the Ogataea clade were isolated by 
      W. T. Starmer and H. J. Phaff from rotting tissue of Opuntia phaeacantha in
      Arizona, USA. Analyses of the sequences of the D1/D2 LSU rRNA gene,
      ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, and translation elongation factor-1alpha (EF-1 alpha) showed that
      this novel species belongs to the Ogataea polymorpha complex formed by Ogataea
      angusta, Ogataea parapolymorpha and Ogataea polymorpha. The novel species differs
      from these species by 4-5 nucleotide substitutions in the D1/D2 domain, by 28-29 
      nucleotide substitutions in the EF-alpha gene and by 18-24 nucleotide
      substitutions and 2-5 indels in the ITS-5.8S region. The name Ogataea haglerorum 
      sp. nov. is proposed for this novel species. The type strain is VKPM Y-2583T
      (=CBS 14645T=UCDFST 17-101T). The Mycobank number is MB 819772.

TI  - Flexible Boron-Doped Diamond (BDD) Electrodes for Plant Monitoring.
LID - E1638 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s17071638 [doi]
AB  - Detecting the bio-potential changes of plants would be useful for monitoring
      their growth and health in the field. A sensitive plant monitoring system with
      flexible boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes prepared from BDD powder and resin 
      (Nafion or Vylon-KE1830) was investigated. The properties of the electrodes were 
      compared with those of small BDD plate-type electrodes by monitoring the
      bioelectric potentials of potted Aloe and hybrid species in the genus Opuntia.
      While flexible BDD electrodes have wide potential windows, their cyclic
      voltammograms are different from those of the BDD plate. Further, the potential
      gap between a pair of electrodes attached to the plants changes as the plants are
      stimulated artificially with a finger touch, suggesting that the bioelectric
      potentials in the plant also changed, manifesting as changes in the potential gap
      between the electrodes. The BDD electrodes were assessed for their response
      reproducibility to a finger stimulus for 30 days. It was concluded that the plant
      monitoring system worked well with flexible BDD electrodes. Further, the
      electrodes were stable, and as reliable as the BDD plate electrodes in this
      study. Thus, a flexible and inexpensive BDD electrode system was successfully
      fabricated for monitoring the bioelectric potential changes in plants.

TI  - Enhancing methyl parathion degradation by the immobilization of Burkholderia sp. 
      isolated from agricultural soils.
LID - 10.1002/mbo3.507 [doi]
AB  - Organophosphate pesticides are of great interest for research because they are
      currently the most commonly used pesticides. In this study, a bacterial strain
      capable of completely degrading methyl parathion (MP) was isolated from
      agricultural soils in central Mexico. This strain was designated strain S5-2 and 
      was identified as Burkholderia cenocepacia. To increase degradation yields, cells
      were immobilized on three different supports: powdered zeolite and Opuntia sp.
      and Agave sp. fibers. The results indicated a significant increase in MP
      hydrolysis and p-nitrophenol (PNP) degradation with immobilized cells compared to
      free cell cultures. Furthermore, immobilized cells were capable of withstanding
      and degrading higher concentrations of PNP compared to cell suspension cultures. 
      The cell viability in the free cell cultures, as well as PNP degradation, was
      affected at concentrations greater than 25 mg/L. In contrast, cells immobilized
      on Opuntia sp. and Agave sp. fibers completely degraded PNP at concentrations of 
      100 mg/L. To verify that MP solution toxicity was decreased by B. cenocepacia
      strain S5-2 via pesticide degradation, we measured the acetylcholinesterase
      activity, both before and after treatment with bacteria. The results demonstrate 
      that the activity of acetylcholinesterase was unaffected after MP degradation by 
      bacteria.

TI  - Reproductive outcomes of anestrous goats supplemented with spineless Opuntia
      megacantha Salm-Dyck protein-enriched cladodes and exposed to the male effect.
PG  - 1511-1516
LID - 10.1007/s11250-017-1356-y [doi]
AB  - The possible influence of the "male effect" upon reproductive outcomes of adult
      anestrous goats under marginal rangeland conditions and supplemented with
      protein-enriched Opuntia megacantha Salm-Dyck was evaluated. Reproductive
      variables included: estrus percentage (EST, %), estrus latency (ESL, hours),
      ovulation percentage (OP, %), ovulation rate (OR, units), average largest
      follicle at ovulation (LFO, mm), largest corpus luteum (LCL, mm), embryo number
      (EBN, units), and embryo implantation percentage (EIP, %). During early May,
      anestrous mix-breed adult goats (Criollo x Alpine-Saanen-Nubian; n = 38, 26
      degrees N) were randomly distributed to (1) Control (CC; n = 12), (2),
      Non-enriched Opuntia (NEO; n = 14), and (3) Protein-enriched Opuntia (PEO; n =
      12). Neither LW (P > 0.05) nor BCS (P > 0.05) or any of the evaluated ovarian
      variables differed (P > 0.05) among treatments; EST = 89.66%, ESL = 53.66 h, OP =
      70.33%, OR = 1.07 units, LFO = 4.5 mm, LCL = 9.6 mm, EBN = 0.94 embryos, and EIP 
      = 48.66%. Irrespective of nutritional supplementation regime, all goats denoted
      an increased response to the male effect just in the middle of the anestrous
      season and managed under marginal grazing conditions during the dry season (May
      to June; 26 degrees N). The use of the male effect successfully invoked
      neurophysiological pathways to re-activate ovarian follicular and luteal pathways
      during the natural anestrous season in the female goat. Yet, such successful
      physiological scenario was not equally exerted to promote an increased embryo
      implantation rate; this issue claims further consideration. Therefore, it is
      essential to align not only the peri-conceptional but also the peri-implantation 
      stages to the best suited environmental conditions in the rangeland, in order to 
      increase both reproductive and economic efficiency while promoting sustainability
      in those rangeland-based marginal goat production systems.

TI  - Nopal (Opuntia ficus indica) protects from metabolic endotoxemia by modifying gut
      microbiota in obese rats fed high fat/sucrose diet.
PG  - 4716
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-05096-4 [doi]
AB  - Current efforts are directed to reducing the gut dysbiosis and inflammation
      produced by obesity. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether
      consuming nopal, a vegetable rich in dietary fibre, vitamin C, and polyphenols
      can reduce the metabolic consequences of obesity by modifying the gut microbiota 
      and preventing metabolic endotoxemia in rats fed a high fat and sucrose diet.
      With this aim, rats were fed a high fat diet with 5% sucrose in the drinking
      water (HFS) for 7 months and then were fed for 1 month with HFS + 5% nopal (HFS +
      N). The composition of gut microbiota was assessed by sequencing the 16S rRNA
      gene. Nopal modified gut microbiota and increased intestinal occludin-1 in the
      HFS + N group. This was associated with a decrease in metabolic endotoxemia,
      glucose insulinotropic peptide, glucose intolerance, lipogenesis, and metabolic
      inflexibility. These changes were accompanied by reduced hepatic steatosis and
      oxidative stress in adipose tissue and brain, and improved cognitive function,
      associated with an increase in B. fragilis. This study supports the use of nopal 
      as a functional food and prebiotic for its ability to modify gut microbiota and
      to reduce metabolic endotoxemia and other obesity-related biochemical
      abnormalities.

TI  - Evolution of GSTD1 in Cactophilic Drosophila.
PG  - 285-294
LID - 10.1007/s00239-017-9798-4 [doi]
AB  - GSTD1 is an insect glutathione S-transferase that has received considerable
      attention because of its role in detoxification of xenobiotic compounds,
      specifically pesticides and plant allelochemicals involved in detoxification, or 
      in the use of some substrates as a nutritional source. GSTD1 has been implicated 
      in the adaptation to a new cactus host in Drosophila mojavensis and thus
      constitutes an interesting candidate to study ecological genetics of adaptation
      in Drosophila. We conducted population genetic and molecular evolution analyses
      of the GstD1 gene in the context of association with different cactus hosts
      (Opuntia sp. vs. Columnar) in nine Drosophila species from the repleta group. We 
      observed strong evidence of selection in GstD1 from D. hexastigma. This species
      is associated with a diverse set of columnar cacti with very complex chemistries.
      GstD1 sequences from D. hexastigma show evidence of a recent selective sweep, and
      positive selection at one residue just outside of the active site of the enzyme. 
      The substitution (Q116T) at the site under selection leads to a conformational
      change in the enzyme that could have important consequences for substrate binding
      efficiency. Our results suggest that GSTD1 from D. hexastigma may have evolved
      improved substrate binding in order to adapt to the diverse chemical environments
      that this species encounters in the wild.

AB  - Cactus stem (Opuntia ficus-indica Mill) is native to Mesoamerica and marketed in 
      different forms such as fresh, frozen or pre-cooked. Worldwide, this vegetable is
      recognized for its pharmaceutical actions, including its antioxidant, diuretic,
      anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and anti-hypercholesterolemic
      properties, as well as their antiviral and antispermatogenic effects. However,
      not all of these properties have been associated with its chemical composition;
      therefore, this review aims to present and integrate information available on the
      physiology and anatomy of cactus stem and its chemical composition, focusing on
      some of the many factors that determine its biofunctionality. (c) 2017 Society of

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opuntia ficus-indica L. Miller fruits, particularly 'Ficodindia
      dell'Etna' of Biancavilla (POD), 'Fico d'india tradizionale di Roccapalumba' with
      protected brand and samples from an experimental field in Pezzolo (Sicily) were
      analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in order to determine
      the multi-element profile. A multivariate chemometric approach, specifically
      principal component analysis (PCA), was applied to individuate how mineral
      elements may represent a marker of geographic origin, which would be useful for
      traceability. RESULTS: PCA has allowed us to verify that the geographical origin 
      of prickly pear fruits is significantly influenced by trace element content, and 
      the results found in Biancavilla PDO samples were linked to the geological
      composition of this volcanic areas. It was observed that two principal components
      accounted for 72.03% of the total variance in the data and, in more detail, PC1
      explains 45.51% and PC2 26.52%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated
      that PCA is an integrated tool for the traceability of food products and, at the 
      same time, a useful method of authentication of typical local fruits such as
      prickly pear. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - This study was focused on the evaluation of the quality and the oxidative
      stability of olive oil added with Opuntia ficus-indica flowers. Two different
      amounts of O. ficus-indica flowers were considered 5 and 15% (w/w). The olive
      oils were evaluated towards their quality, fatty acids profile, total phenol
      contents and thermal properties by differential scanning calorimetry. The
      oxidative stability was also monitored by employing the Rancimat and the oven
      test based on accelerating the oxidation process during storage. The addition of 
      O. ficus-indica flowers induced an increase in free acidity values and a
      variation in fatty acids profile of olive oils but values remained under the
      limits required for an extra-virgin olive oil. The obtained olive oils were
      nutritionally enriched due to the increase in their phenols content. The
      oxidative stability was generally improved, mainly in olive oil enriched with 5% 
      Opuntia ficus-indica flowers. These findings proved that this enriched olive oil 
      could be considered as a product with a greater added value.

AB  - Ultrasonic assisted extraction (UAE) of pectin from Opuntia ficus indica (OFI)
      cladodes after mucilage removal was attempted using the response surface
      methodology. The process variables were optimized by the isovariant central
      composite design in order to improve the pectin extraction yield. The optimum
      condition obtained was: sonication time 70min, temperature 70 degrees C, pH 1.5
      and the water-material ratio 30ml/g. This condition was validated and the
      performance of experimental extraction was 18.14%+/-1.41%, which was closely
      linked to the predicted value (19.06%). Thus, UAE present a promising alternative
      to conventional extraction process thanks to its high efficiency which was
      achieved in less time and at lower temperatures. The pectin extracted by UAE from
      OFI cladodes (UAEPC) has a low degree of esterification, high uronic acid
      content, important functional properties and good anti-radical activity. These
      results are in favor of the use of UAEPC as potential additive in food industry.

TI  - Pupal emergence pattern in cactophilic Drosophila and the effect of host plants.
LID - 10.1111/1744-7917.12484 [doi]
AB  - Drosophila buzzatii and D. koepferae are sibling cactophilic species. The former 
      breeds primarily on prickly pears (genus Opuntia) whereas the latter breeds on
      columnar cacti of the genera Cereus and Trichocereus, although with certain
      degree of niche overlapping. We examined the interspecific differences in diurnal
      temporal patterns of adult emergence from puparia and evaluated whether this
      behavior is affected by rearing in the different cactus hosts available in
      nature. We detected important host-dependent genetic variation for this trait
      differentially affecting the emergence schedule of these species. Diurnal pattern
      of emergence time was directly correlated with developmental time and negatively 
      correlated with adult wing size, suggesting that early emergences are at least
      indirectly correlated with increased fitness. We discussed our results in terms
      of their putative effects on fitness and the genetic-metabolic pathways that
      would be presumably affected by host's nutritional-chemical differences.

TI  - Opuntia spp.: Characterization and Benefits in Chronic Diseases.
PG  - 8634249
LID - 10.1155/2017/8634249 [doi]
AB  - Opuntia species have been used for centuries as food resources and in traditional
      folk medicine for their nutritional properties and their benefit in chronic
      diseases, particularly diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.
      These plants are largely distributed in America, Africa, and the Mediterranean
      basin. Opuntia spp. have great economic potential because they grow in arid and
      desert areas, and O. ficus-indica, the domesticated O. species, is used as a
      nutritional and pharmaceutical agent in various dietary and value-added products.
      Though differences in the phytochemical composition exist between wild and
      domesticated (O. ficus-indica) Opuntia spp., all Opuntia vegetatives (pear,
      roots, cladodes, seeds, and juice) exhibit beneficial properties mainly resulting
      from their high content in antioxidants (flavonoids, ascorbate), pigments
      (carotenoids, betalains), and phenolic acids. Other phytochemical components
      (biopeptides, soluble fibers) have been characterized and contribute to the
      medicinal properties of Opuntia spp. The biological properties of Opuntia spp.
      have been investigated on cellular and animal models and in clinical trials in
      humans, allowing characterization and clarification of the protective effect of
      Opuntia-enriched diets in chronic diseases. This review is an update on the
      phytochemical composition and biological properties of Opuntia spp. and their
      potential interest in medicine.

AB  - In vitro antioxidative and anti-inflammatory bioassay-guided fractionation of the
      methanol: ethyl acetate crude extract of the thalli of red seaweed Gracilaria
      opuntia collected from the Gulf of Mannar led to the isolation of a new
      morpholine alkaloid 3-(2-ethyl-6-((3Z,7Z)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydroazocin-5-yl)hexyl)
      morpholin-6-one. The substituted azocinyl morpholinone recorded significant
      1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazil free radical scavenging activities (IC50 ~ 0.086
      mg/mL) compared to the commercially available antioxidants, butylated
      hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, and alpha-tocopherol (IC50 > 0.20
      mg/mL). The title compound showed greater cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitory
      activity (IC50 0.84 mg/mL) in conjunction with in vitro 5-lipoxidase inhibitory
      activity (IC50 0.85 mg/mL) than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
      The test compound had better selectivity index (COX-1/COX-2 ratio) (1.17 mg/mL)
      compared to aspirin (0.02 mg/mL), Na salicylate (0.73 mg/mL) and ibuprofen (0.44 
      mg/mL). The animals challenged with the substituted azocinyl morpholinone
      significantly mitigated the carrageenan-induced paw edema in time-dependent
      manner till the end of 6 h.

AB  - The effect of spineless cactus intake (Opuntia ficus-indica) on blood glucose
      (BG) levels in lactating sows and its impact on daily and total feed intake
      (dFI(-1) and TFI, respectively), body weight loss (BWL), and weaning-estrus
      interval length (WEI) were evaluated. Thirty-four hybrid (Yorkshire x Landrace x 
      Pietrain) sows in lactation phase were used. Sows were divided into two groups:
      G1 (n = 17) where they received commercial feed and G2 (n = 17) provided with
      commercial feed plus an average of 2.0 +/- 0.5 kg spineless cactus, based on a
      sow's body weight. The variables evaluated were BG, dFI(-1), TFI, BWL, and WEI.
      Statistical analysis was performed by using a fixed and mixed model methodology, 
      under a repeated measurements experiment. Group effects were found on all
      analyzed variables (P < 0.05). The BG was lower in G2 (55.2 and 64.5 mg/dL pre-
      and post-prandial, respectively), compared to that in G1 (70.9 and 80.1 mg/dL
      pre- and post-prandial, respectively) (P < 0.05). G2 showed better performance
      than G1 for dFI(-1), BWL, and WEI (P < 0.05) whose averages were 5.5 +/- 1.8 kg, 
      7.4 +/- 4.5%, and 5.3 +/- 1.2 days, respectively. Averages for these variables in
      G1 were 4.7 +/- 1.5 kg, 16.8 +/- 4.6%, and 6.1 +/- 1.6 days, respectively. Intake
      of spineless cactus reduced BG levels in lactating sows, generating greater
      dFI(-1), lower BWL at the end of lactation, and a lower WEI.

TI  - Activity of anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antigenotoxic of the aqueous flower 
      extracts of Opuntia microdasys Lem.Pfeiff.
PG  - 1056-1063
LID - 10.1111/jphp.12734 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic and the
      anti-inflammatory activity of Opuntia microdasys at post flowering stage, F3
      (OMF3) in rat and, in other hand, its antigenotoxic effects by the Allium cepa
      test. METHODS: OMF3 extracts were screened for activity of analgesic and
      anti-inflammatory using, respectively, the acetic acid writhing test in mice and 
      the carrageenan-induced paw oedema assay in rats. The antigenotoxic has been
      evaluated by A. cepa test. KEY FINDINGS: OMF3 extracts showed a higher analgesic 
      and anti-inflammatory activity at 100 mg/kg (72.03% and 70.11%) as determined by 
      the tests of acetic acid-induced writhing and carrageenan-induced oedema,
      respectively. Furthermore, the OMF3 aqueous extracts have a preventive
      antimutagenic potential, at lower concentration (EC50 approximately 60 mug/ml),
      against H2 O2 -mediated DNA damage in A. cepa root meristem cells with an
      efficient restoration of the mitotic index in comparison with controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, the flower of O. microdasys at post flowering
      stage may be use as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antimutagenic agents.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of aqueous extracts from four plants on bacterial isolates
      from periodontitis patients.
PG  - 13394-13404
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-8942-4 [doi]
AB  - Four aqueous extracts of different plant organs are the following: Artemisia
      herba-alba, Opuntia ficus-indica, Camellia sinensis and Phlomis crinita were
      evaluated against two bacterial strains: Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella 
      intermedia, which are implicated in periodontal diseases. By using a disc method,
      these plant extracts demonstrated powerful bacterial activity against these
      Gram-negative strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration values of the four
      plant extracts varied between 0.03 and 590.82 mg/ml for the microbes. Another
      assay using commercial antibiotics and antibacterials as positive controls was
      also conducted. Values obtained after statistical analysis of inhibition
      diameters of all plant extracts demonstrated that for P. gingivalis, the aqueous 
      extracts of A. herba-alba and O. ficus-indica were most effective, followed by
      those of C. sinensis and P. crinita. For P. intermedia, aqueous extracts of O.
      ficus-indica and C. sinensis appeared to be more efficient with significantly
      different (P > 0.05) inhibition diameters, followed by those of O. ficus-indica
      and P. crinita. In summary, the statistical results reveal that these plant
      extracts exert stronger antibacterial activity on P. intermedia germ as compared 
      to P. gingivalis.

      induced by high-fat diet.
PG  - 225-237
LID - 10.1080/13813455.2017.1307413 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse cytoprotective effect of polysaccharides
      compound from Opuntia stricta (O. stricta) cladode (POS) in vitro including its
      radical scavenging activities and protective effects against
      hypercholesterolaemia. Our results showed that glucose was the dominant
      monosaccharides (30.35%). Arabinose, pyranose, fructose, galactose, glucose,
      sorbitol, S-inositol, M-inositol, trehalose and saccharose found in this species.
      O. stricta polysaccharides did not cause any cytotoxic effect on HepG2 cells
      within the range of concentrations tested (0-400 mugml(-1)). Pre-treatment of
      HepG2 cells with POS (100 mugml(-1)) significantly (p < .05) protected against
      cytotoxicity induced by DPPH and ABTS radicals. The POS showed strong antioxidant
      potential in vitro. The results indicated also that POS significantly prevented
      hypercholesterolaemia-induced elevation of serum biomarkers and induced increase 
      in serum lipid profile. Moreover, the hypercholesterolaemia characterised by
      elevated lipid peroxidation (MDA) and reduced antioxidant enzyme defences (SOD,
      CAT and GPx) was restored by POS treatment.

PG  - 691-701

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the fermentation of dietary fiber from
      green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and prickly pear shell (Opuntia ficus-indica) by 
      Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium bifidum 450B growing as
      mono-culture and co-culture, the fermentation products, and proteins expressed
      during this process. The analysis of the fermentation profile showed a major
      growth of bacteria in the culture media of each dietary fiber supplemented with
      glucose, and particularly B. bifidum 450B at 48 h showed the highest growth. In
      the case of the co-culture, the growth was lower indicating the possible negative
      interaction between L. acidophilus LA-5 and B. bifidum 450B and may be due to the
      less amount of carbohydrates and the high content of non-soluble fiber that
      affected the nutrients availability for the bacterial strains. The pH changes
      indicated the presence of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), being acetate
      (46-100%) the main SCFA. Changes in the proteome concerned proteins that are
      involved in carbohydrate and other carbohydrate pathways. The characterization of
      the bacteria according to the growth, metabolites, and proteins expressed allows 
      understanding the response to the change of environmental conditions and could be
      useful to understand L. acidophilus LA-5 and B. bifidum 450B strains' adaptation 
      to specific applications.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate alpha-glucosidase inhibitory
      and antidiabetic effects of Nopal water extract (NPWE) and Nopal dry power (NADP)
      in low-dose streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetic rats fed a high-fat diet
      (HFD). The type 2 diabetic rat model was induced by HFD and low-dose STZ. The
      rats were divided into four groups as follows: (1) nondiabetic rats fed a regular
      diet (RD-Control); (2) low-dose STZ-induced diabetic rats fed HFD
      (HF-STZ-Control); (3) low-dose STZ-induced diabetic rats fed HFD and supplemented
      with NPWE (100 mg/kg body weight, HF-STZ-NPWE); and (4) low-dose STZ-induced
      diabetic rats fed HFD and supplemented with comparison medication (rosiglitazone,
      10 mg/kg, body weight, HF-STZ-Rosiglitazone). In results, NPWE and NADP had IC50 
      values of 67.33 and 86.68 mug/mL, both of which exhibit inhibitory activities but
      lower than that of acarbose (38.05 mug/mL) while NPWE group significantly
      decreased blood glucose levels compared to control and NPDP group on glucose
      tolerance in the high-fat diet fed rats model (P < 0.05). Also, the blood glucose
      levels of HR-STZ-NPWE group were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than
      HR-STZ-Control group on low-dose STZ-induced diabetic rats fed HFD. Based on
      these findings, we suggested that NPWE could be considered for the prevention
      and/or treatment of blood glucose and a potential use as a dietary supplement.

TI  - The fatty acid profile of fat depots from Santa Ines sheep fed spineless cactus
      (Opuntia ficus-indica Mill.).
PG  - 4438-4444
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.8303 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fat is the tissue that varies most in animals from both a
      quantitative and distribution perspective. It plays a fundamental biological role
      as energy storage during food scarcity. Renal, pelvic and internal fat are
      deposited first. These fats are used to identify fatty acid profiles that may be 
      considered beneficial or unhealthy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      fatty acid profile of fat depots in Santa Ines sheep finished in confinement with
      spineless cactus in their diets. RESULTS: The treatments included increasing
      levels of spineless cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica Mill.): T1 = 0%, T2 = 30%, T3 = 
      50%, and T4 = 70%. The diets significantly affected the adipose depots. The
      orthogonal contrast between the diet with no cactus (control) and the other diets
      indicates that the quantity of saturated fatty acids decreased and that the
      levels of mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids increased in animals
      fed spineless cactus. CONCLUSION: The use of spineless cactus in the diets of
      Santa Ines sheep affects the lipid profile of their fat depots, reducing the
      quantity of saturated fatty acids and increasing the quantity of mono-unsaturated
      and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The fatty acid profile of the fat depots
      indicates that these fats can be used to formulate meat products and add economic
      and nutritional value to such products, which increases sheep farmers' incomes.

TI  - Prevalence and behavior of multidrug-resistant Salmonella strains on raw whole
      and cut nopalitos (Opuntia ficus-indica L.) and on nopalitos salads.
PG  - 4117-4123
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.8279 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of multidrug-resistant Salmonella in vegetables is a
      significant public health concern. Nopalito is a cactaceous that is commonly
      consumed either raw or cooked in Mexico and other countries. The presence of
      antibiotic-resistant Salmonella strains on raw whole nopalitos (RWN, without
      prickles), raw nopalitos cut into squares (RNCS) and in cooked nopalitos salads
      (CNS) samples was determined. In addition, the behavior of multidrug-resistant
      Salmonella isolates on RWN, RNCS and CNS at 25 degrees +/- 2 degrees C and 3
      degrees +/- 2 degrees C was investigated. RESULTS: One hundred samples of RWN,
      100 of RNCS and 100 more of CNS were collected from public markets. Salmonella
      strains were isolated and identified in 30, 30 and 10% of the samples,
      respectively. Seventy multidrug-resistant Salmonella strains were isolated from
      all the nopalitos samples. Multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolates survived at
      least 15 days on RWN at 25 degrees +/- 2 degrees C or 3 degrees +/- 2 degrees C. 
      Multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolates grew in the RNCS and CNS samples at 25
      degrees +/- 2 degrees C. However, at 3 degrees +/- 2 degrees C the bacterial
      growth was inhibited. CONCLUSION: This is the first report about
      multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolation from raw nopalitos and nopalitos salads.
      Nopalitos from markets are very likely to be an important factor contributing to 
      the endemicity of multidrug-resistant Salmonella-related gastroenteritis in
      Mexico. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - Cactus cladodes (Opuntia humifusa) extract minimizes the effects of UV
      irradiation on keratinocytes and hairless mice.
PG  - 1032-1040
LID - 10.1080/13880209.2017.1286357 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Cactus cladodes [Opuntia humifusa (Raf.) Raf. (Cactaceae)] is one of the
      cactus genera, which has long been used as a folk medicine for skin disorders.
      OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the skincare potential of cactus cladodes
      extract (OHE), including its ability to regulate ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced
      hyaluronic acid (HA) production. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression levels of
      hyaluronic acid synthases (HASs) and hyaluronidase (HYAL) were measured in
      UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells with OHE treatment (10, 25, 50, 100 mug/mL) by
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The HA content was analyzed in
      hairless mice (SKH-1, male, 6 weeks old) treated with OHE for 10 weeks by using
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and
      immunohistological staining were performed to examine epidermal thickness and
      levels of CD44 and hyaluronic acid-binding protein (HABP). RESULTS: HA synthases 
      (HAS,1 HAS2, HAS3) mRNA levels were increased by 1.9-, 2.2- and 1.6-fold,
      respectively, with OHE treatment (100 mug/mL), while UVB-induced increase of
      hyaluronidase mRNA significantly decreased by 35%. HA content in animal was
      decreased from 42.9 to 27.1 ng/mL by OHE treatment. HAS mRNA levels were
      decreased by 39%, but HYAL mRNA was increased by 50% in OHE group. CD44 and HABP 
      levels, which were greatly increased by UVB-irradiation, were reduced by 64 and
      60%, respectively. Epidermal thickness, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and
      erythema formation was also decreased by 45 (45.7 to 24.2 mum), 48 (48.8 to 25
      g/h/m(2)) and 33%, respectively. CONCLUSION: OHE protects skin from UVB-induced
      skin degeneration in HaCaT cells and hairless mice.

TI  - Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes as a functional ingredient: bioactive compounds
      profile and their effect on antioxidant quality of bread.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1186/s12944-016-0397-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the context of a balanced diet, the antioxidant-rich food
      consumption is a preventive way of many degenerative diseases. Consequently,
      improving the nutraceutical quality of traditional foods such as bakery products 
      is an interesting approach. Considering the present consumer's demand, cladodes
      from prickly pear that were traditionally used as a valuable food as well as in
      folk medicine for the treatment of several chronic diseases were investigated for
      their use in bread production to improve its functionality. METHODS: Bioactive
      substances were determined by liquid chromatography-high resolution electrospray 
      ionization mass spectrometry (LC-HRESIMS) analysis. Dough rheological properties 
      were characterized by alveographic measurements. Bread antioxidant quality was
      evaluated by total phenolics content, DPPH* radical-scavenging, metal (Fe(2+))
      chelating and Fe(3+) reducing power determinations. RESULTS: LC-HRESIMS analysis 
      of the cladodes extract allowed the identification of 9 flavonoids, 2 phenolics, 
      1 alkaloid and 1 terpenoid compounds. Cladodes powder enrichment induced
      important modifications on the dough rheological parameters in terms of the
      extensibility (L) and deformation energy (W) decrease. Moreover, cladodes powder 
      addition to bread resulted in a decrease in both crust and crumb colour
      parameters (L*, a* and b*). A 5% supplementation resulted in an increase of the
      bread yield and bread specific volume by 8.9 and 25%, respectively.
      Interestingly, Bread containing cladodes powder showed enhanced total phenolics
      content and antioxidant potential as compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS:
      Substitution of wheat flour by the cladodes powder at 5% level was optimal for
      improving the total phenolics content and the antioxidant potential of bread
      without having any negative effect on its sensory acceptability. Cladodes from
      Opuntia ficus-indica could be considered as a potential health-promoting
      functional ingredient in bakery products.

AB  - Opuntia ficus indica (family Cactaceae) is a typical Mediterranean plant, mainly 
      used in food and traditional folk medicine. The present study was designed to
      evaluate the protective effect of Opuntia ficus indica extract against
      chlorpyrifos (CPF)-induced immunotoxicity in rats. The experimental animals
      consisted of four groups of Wistar rats (5-6 weeks old) of eight each: a control 
      group, a group treated with CPF (10mg/kg), a group treated with Opuntia ficus
      indica extract (100mg/kg), and a group treated with cactus extract then treated
      with CPF. These components were daily administered by gavage for 30days. After
      treatment, immunotoxicity was estimated by a count of thymocytes, splenocytes,
      stem cells in the bone marrow, relative weights of thymus and spleen, DNA
      aspects, and oxidative stress status in these organs. Results showed that CPF
      could induce thymus atrophy, splenomegaly, and a decrease in the cell number in
      the bone marrow. It also increased the oxidative stress markers resulting in
      elevated levels of the lipid peroxidation with a concomitant decrease in the
      levels of enzymatic antioxidants (SOD, CAT, GPx) in both spleen and thymus, and
      also degradation of thymocyte and splenocyte DNA. Consistent histological changes
      were found in the spleen and thymus under CPF treatment. However, administration 
      of Opuntia ficus indica extract was found to alleviate this CPF-induced damage.

TI  - Bone Mineral Density, Mechanical, Microstructural Properties and Mineral Content 
      of the Femur in Growing Rats Fed with Cactus Opuntia ficus indica (L.) Mill.
      (Cactaceae) Cladodes as Calcium Source in Diet.
LID - E108 [pii]

AB  - Mechanical, microstructural properties, mineral content and bone mineral density 
      (BMD) of the femur were evaluated in growing rats fed with Opuntia ficus indica
      (L.) Mill. (Cactaceae) cladodes at different maturity stages as calcium source.
      Male weanling rats were fed with cladodes at early maturity stage (25 and 60 days
      of age, belonging to groups N-60 and N-200, respectively) and cladodes at late
      maturity stage (100 and 135 days of age, belonging to groups N-400 and N-600,
      respectively) for 6 weeks. Additionally, a control group fed with calcium
      carbonate as calcium source was included for comparative purposes. All diets were
      fitted to the same calcium content (5 g/kg diet). The failure load of femurs was 
      significantly lower (p </= 0.05) in groups N-60 and N-200 in comparison to N-400,
      N-600 and control groups. The cortical width (Ct.Wi) and trabecular thickness
      (Tb.Th) of the femurs in control and N-600 groups were significantly higher (p
      </= 0.05) than Ct.Wi and Tb.Th of femurs in groups N-60 and N-200. Trabecular
      separation of the femurs in N-60 and N-200 groups showed the highest values
      compared with all experimental groups. The highest calcium content in the femurs 
      were observed in control, N-600 and N-400 groups; whereas the lowest phosphorus
      content in the bones were detected in N-200, N-600 and N-400 groups. Finally, the
      BMD in all experimental groups increased with age; nevertheless, the highest
      values were observed in N-600 and control groups during pubertal and adolescence 
      stages. The results derived from this research demonstrate, for the first time,
      that the calcium found in Opuntia ficus indica cladodes is actually bioavailable 
      and capable of improving mineral density and mechanical and microstructural
      properties of the bones. These findings suggest that the consumption of cladodes 
      at late maturity stage within the diet might have a beneficial impact on bone
      health.

TI  - Immunostimulatory Activity of Opuntia ficus-indica var. Saboten Cladodes
      Fermented by Lactobacillus plantarum and Bacillus subtilis in RAW 264.7
      Macrophages.
PG  - 131-139

AB  - To increase the functionality of Opuntia ficus-indica var. saboten cladodes, it
      was fermented by Lactobacillus plantarum and Bacillus subtilis. Eighty percent
      methanol extracts were investigated for their effects on nitric oxide (NO)
      production, cytokine secretion, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity, and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in RAW 264.7 cells.
      Methanol extracts of L. plantarum culture medium (LPCME) and B. subtilis culture 
      medium (BSCME) did not affect lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production but,
      at 500 mug/mL, increased interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced NO production by 55.2 and
      66.5 muM, respectively, in RAW 264.7 cells. In RAW 264.7 cells not treated with
      LPS and IFN-gamma, LPCME did not affect NO production, but BSCME increased NO
      production significantly in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, BSCME induced
      the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta
      (IL-1beta) in RAW 264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. BSCME at 500 mug/mL
      increased TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA levels by 83.8% and 82.2%, respectively.
      BSCME increased NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase activity in a dose-dependent
      manner; 500 mug/mL BSCME increased activity 9.1-fold compared with the control.
      BSCME induced the phosphorylation of p38, c-JUN NH2-terminal protein kinase
      (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in a dose-dependent
      manner, but did not affect total ERK levels. In conclusion, BSCME exerted
      immunostimulatory effects, which were mediated by MAPK phosphorylation and
      NF-kappaB activation, resulting in increased TNF-alpha and IL-1beta gene
      expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Therefore, BSCM shows promise for use as an 
      immunostimulatory therapeutic.

TI  - Betanin, isolated from fruits of Opuntia elatior Mill attenuates renal fibrosis
      in diabetic rats through regulating oxidative stress and TGF-beta pathway.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The fruits of Opuntia elatior Mill are being used
      traditionally in different disease condition like diabetes, obesity, asthma,
      inflammatory disorders, and anemia. Betanin, a compound isolated from fruits of
      Opuntia elatior Mill has potent anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activity.
      Recent study from our lab indicated the protective effect of betanin against high
      glucose induced rat renal epithelial cell fibrosis and matrix accumulation, major
      features of diabetic nephropathy (DN). However the molecular mechanism of betanin
      in DN has not yet been fully elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the present
      study was to further investigate the anti-fibrotic mechanisms of betanin against 
      streptozotocin (STZ) induced DN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Betanin was isolated from
      fruits of Opuntia elatior Mill (Cactaceae) and structure was elucidated using
      spectroscopy (UV, IR, 1H-NMR and mass). STZ was injected intraperitoneally with
      single dose of 50mg/kg for diabetes induction. In order to develop DN the animals
      were left in diabetes condition without any treatment during the following 4
      weeks. Betanin (25, 50 and 100mg/kg/day) and lisinopril (5mg/kg/day, reference
      compound) were orally administered for 8 weeks after the induction of DN. Renal
      function, blood glucose, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and
      antioxidant enzyme activities in the kidney tissue were measured. Kidney tissue
      samples were used for glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and
      morphometric studies. The expression of transforming growth factor-beta
      (TGF-beta), type IV collagen, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and
      E-cadherin in kidney tissue were evaluated using reverse transcription-polymerase
      chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Betanin was successfully
      isolated from fruits of Opuntia elatior Mill (Cactaceae) and purified by column
      chromatography. The results showed that betanin attenuated diabetic kidney injury
      by significantly inhibiting proteinuria, blood glucose, serum creatinine and BUN 
      levels and restored antioxidant enzyme activities in kidney tissue. Histological 
      studies exhibited that betanin treatment reduced the glomerular surface area,
      glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Furthermore, betanin
      modulated mRNA and protein expression of TGF-beta, type IV collagen, alpha-SMA
      and E-cadherin in kidney. CONCLUSIONS: The results conclude that betanin can
      effectively suppress renal fibrosis in DN, and may slow down the progression to
      end-stage renal disease by regulating TGF-beta signal pathway.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In the study area, knowledge related to the
      traditional uses of medicinal plants is totally in the custody of elder community
      members and local herbalists. The younger generation is unaware of the
      traditional knowledge, however with only few exceptions. Therefore, this study
      was planned with objective to document the medicinal importance of plants,
      conserve this precious indigenous knowledge, and share it among other communities
      through published literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was collected through
      semi-structured interviews from the community members and local herbalists. The
      reported plants were collected post interviews and later on pressed on herbarium 
      vouchers for reference. Afterwards, the data was analyzed through Use value (UV) 
      and Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC). RESULTS: In total, 79 medicinal plant
      species were used for the treatment of different ailments in the study region.
      Out of the total plant species, 28 species were not reported from any other
      mountainous communities across the country. In this study, the ethno-medicinal
      value of Opuntia littoralis (Engelm.) Cockerell and Viola indica W.Becker was
      reported for the first time, which have moderate confidential level in terms of
      their medicinal uses in the study area. Important medicinal plants of the region 
      with high UV are Berberis lycium Royle (0.94), V. indica (0.90), Isodon rugosus
      (Wall. ex Benth.) Codd (0.88), Foeniculum vulgare Mill. (0.87), Peganum harmala L
      (0.86), Solanum virginianum L. (0.85), and Cassia fistula L. (0.79). Medicinal
      plants with higher RFC values are Calotropis procera (Aiton) Dryand. (0.86),
      Cannabis sativa L. (0.82), Mentha piperita L. (0.82), Mentha longifolia (L.)
      Huds. (0.76), Allium sativum L. (0.73), Coriandrum sativum L. (0.73), and F.
      vulgare (0.72). CONCLUSIONS: Traditional knowledge on folk medicines is directly 
      linked to the local culture, faith and perception. This knowledge is gaining high
      threat of extinction because of its limitation to a small portion of the society 
      in the region. Therefore, future studies are recommended in similar regions for
      the documentation of this precious knowledge. Moreover, our study has also
      identified some important and newly reported medicinal plants from the
      ethno-medicinal perspective, which needs to be studied pharmacologically and
      toxicologically.

TI  - Seasonal Effects on the Population, Morphology and Reproductive Behavior of
      Narnia femorata (Hemiptera: Coreidae).
LID - E13 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects8010013 [doi]
AB  - Many insects are influenced by the phenology of their host plants. In North
      Central Florida, Narnia femorata (Hemiptera: Coreidae) spends its entire life
      cycle living and feeding on Opuntia mesacantha ssp. lata. This cactus begins
      producing flower buds in April that lead to unripe green fruit in June that ripen
      into red fruit through December. Many morphological and behavioral
      characteristics of N. femorata are known to be affected by cactus phenology in a 
      controlled laboratory setting, including the degree of sexual dimorphism and
      mating behavior. Our goal with this study was to determine if similar phenotypic 
      changes of N. femorata occurred over time in the wild, and the extent to which
      these changes were concordant with phenological changes in its host plant.
      Further, we investigate the length of the insect mouthparts (beak) over time.
      Ongoing work has suggested that beak length may change across cohorts of
      developing insects in response to feeding deep within cactus fruit where seed and
      pulp depth decrease as the fruit ripens. Our results revealed a drop in cactus
      fruit abundance between the months of July through October 2015 as cactus fruits 
      turned red and ripened. Simultaneously, the average body size of both males and
      females of N. femorata declined at two sampled sites. Male hind femora (a
      sexually-selected weapon) decreased disproportionately in size over time so that 
      males later in the year had relatively smaller hind femora for their body size.
      The sex-specific patterns of morphological change led to increased sexual-size
      dimorphism and decreased sexual dimorphism for hind femora later in the year.
      Further, we found that beak length decreased across cohorts of insects as cactus 
      fruit ripened, suggesting phenotypic plasticity in mouthpart length. Behavioral
      studies revealed that female readiness to mate increased as the season
      progressed. In sum, we found pronounced changes in the phenotypes of these
      insects in the field. Although this study is far from comprehensive, it provides 
      tantalizing patterns that suggest many directions for future research.

TI  - Cactus (Opuntia humifusa) water extract ameliorates loperamide-induced
      constipation in rats.
PG  - 49
LID - 10.1186/s12906-016-1552-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Korean cactus Cheonnyuncho (Opuntia humifusa) is rich in pectin,
      phenols, flavonoids, and minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. Some Koreans
      drink Cheonnyuncho juice prepared by grinding Cheonnyuncho with water.
      Cheonnyuncho is well known for its functional properties and antioxidant effects,
      but its effect on constipation has not been sufficiently studied. METHODS:
      Loperamide (2 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously to induce constipation in rats. 
      The animals were divided into four groups: a normal group (NOR), constipation
      control group (CON), and two constipation groups receiving the Cheonnyuncho
      extract (CE) at two different concentrations in drinking water, 3% (L-CE group)
      and 6% (H-CE group), for 25 days. RESULTS: The fecal pellet numbers of NOR and
      L-CE were significantly increased from 35.67 +/- 2.09 (CON) to 50.60 +/- 1.38 and
      46.50 +/- 2.91 after loperamide treatment, respectively (p < 0.05). The water
      content of fecal excretions was significantly enhanced in only the L-CE group
      (33.05 +/- 0.49%) compared to control (23.38 +/- 1.26%) (p < 0.05) after
      loperamide treatment. The oral intake of CE (L-CE and H-CE groups) significantly 
      increased levels of the intestinal transit ratio (45.25 +/- 1.86% and 41.05 +/-
      2.47%, respectively) compared to the CON group (32.15 +/- 2.05%) (p < 0.05).
      Treatment with the low concentration of CE significantly increased fecal levels
      of acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids, as well as the total
      short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration. Histological analyses revealed that 
      the thickness of the distal colon also increased in the CE-treated groups in a
      dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Constipation decreased when CE was fed to the
      rats. In particular, the fecal pellet number and water content, as well as
      histological parameters such as distal colon thickness, improved. The CE
      treatment also increased the fecal SCFA content. These results show that the
      extract of Cheonnyuncho (O. humifusa) alleviated the symptoms of
      loperamide-induced constipation.

TI  - Protective Effect of Cactus Cladode Extracts on Peroxisomal Functions in
      Microglial BV-2 Cells Activated by Different Lipopolysaccharides.
LID - E102 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules22010102 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we aimed to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
      properties of Opuntia ficus-indica cactus cladode extracts in microglia BV-2
      cells. Inflammation associated with microglia activation in neuronal injury can
      be achieved by LPS exposure. Using four different structurally and biologically
      well-characterized LPS serotypes, we revealed a structure-related differential
      effect of LPS on fatty acid beta-oxidation and antioxidant enzymes in
      peroxisomes: Escherichia coli-LPS decreased ACOX1 activity while Salmonella
      minnesota-LPS reduced only catalase activity. Different cactus cladode extracts
      showed an antioxidant effect through microglial catalase activity activation and 
      an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing nitric oxide (NO) LPS-dependent
      production. These results suggest that cactus extracts may possess a
      neuroprotective activity through the induction of peroxisomal antioxidant
      activity and the inhibition of NO production by activated microglial cells.

AB  - The Opuntia ficus-indica multiple properties are reflected in the increasing
      interest of chemists in the identification of its natural components having
      pharmaceutical and/or cosmetical applications. Here we report the structural
      elucidation of Opuntia ficus-indica mucilage that highlighted the presence of
      components differing for their chemical nature and the molecular weight
      distribution. The high molecular weight components were identified as a linear
      galactan polymer and a highly branched xyloarabinan. The low molecular weight
      components were identified as lactic acid, D-mannitol, piscidic, eucomic and
      2-hydroxy-4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-butanoic acids. A wound healing assay was
      performed in order to test the cicatrizing properties of the various components, 
      highlighting the ability of these latter to fasten dermal regeneration using a
      simplified in vitro cellular model based on a scratched keratinocytes monolayer. 
      The results showed that the whole Opuntia mucilage and the low molecular weight
      components are active in the wound repair.

AB  - The yield of mucilage extracted from cladodes of Opuntia dillenii (Ker-Gawl) Haw 
      in aqueous medium was 6.2%. The neutral sugar comprised of arabinose (38.80%),
      galactose (33.00%), rhamnose (15.70%), xylose (5.10%), and glucose (5.10%). The
      mucilage showed pseudo plastic behavior with good swelling index (20%), water
      holding capacity (g water/g dry sample; 4+/-0.10) and micrometric properties. In 
      addition, mucilage presented intrinsic viscosity of 3.7 dL/g with average
      molecular weight of 1.9x10(3)kDa. The FTIR and NMR spectra of extracted mucilage 
      showed characteristic polysaccharide nature. Further, the mucilage exhibited
      anti-obesity property through lipase inhibition. These findings could highlight
      that isolated mucilage could be exploited as an additive in food and
      pharmaceutical sector.

AB  - Optimization of microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of water-soluble pectin (WSP)
      from Opuntia ficus indica cladodes was performed using Response Surface
      Methodology. The effect of extraction time (X1), microwave power (X2), pH (X3)
      and solid-to-liquid ratio (X4) on the extraction yield was examined. The optimum 
      conditions of MAE were as follows: X1=2.15min; X2=517W; X3=2.26 and X4=2g/30.6mL.
      The maximum obtained yield of pectin extraction was 12.57%. Total carbohydrate
      content of WSP is about 95.5% including 34.4% of Galacturonic acid.
      Pectin-related proteins represent only the 0.66% of WSP mass. HPSEC and light
      scattering analyses reveal that WSP is mostly constituted of high molecular
      pectin and FTIR measurements show that the microwave treatment does not alter the
      chemical structure of WSP, in which Galacturonic acid content and yield are 34.4%
      and 4.33%, respectively. Overall, application of MAE can give rise to high
      quality pectin.

TI  - Microbiological Quality of Fresh Nopal Juice.
LID - E46 [pii]
AB  - The consumption of fresh nopal cactus juice is widely popular among
      health-conscious consumers in Mexico. The juice is prepared from fresh cladodes
      that have only been rinsed with tap water and are not subjected to a
      pasteurization or terminal bacterial reduction process. The aim of this study was
      to evaluate the microbial quality of commercially available fresh juices (n =
      162) made with nopal in Texcoco, State of Mexico, during the summer and spring
      season. Standard microbiological methods, the PCR technique and the serological
      method were used for isolation and identification of bacteria. All samples
      contained total coliforms and 91% were positive for Escherichia coli. Although
      total coliforms and E. coli were detected throughout the study, their populations
      were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in winter and spring, respectively.
      Citrobacter youngae was found in 20% of the samples, an unidentified species of
      Citrobacter in 10%, C. freundii and Proteus mirabilis in 3%, and Salmonella
      Javiana in 1%. The presence of these microorganisms, especially Salmonella, in
      the nopal juices is unacceptable due to its health significance. The information 
      generated in this study is relevant for human health risk assessment associated
      with the consumption of unpasteurized nopal juices and potential interventions to
      minimize pathogen contamination.

TI  - Phytochemical, antioxidant and protective effect of cactus cladodes extract
      against lithium-induced liver injury in rats.
PG  - 516-525
AB  - CONTEXT: Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill. (Castaceae) (cactus) is used in Tunisian
      medicine for the treatment of various diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study determines 
      phytochemical composition of cactus cladode extract (CCE). It also investigates
      antioxidant activity and hepatoprotective potential of CCE against lithium
      carbonate (Li2CO3)-induced liver injury in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Twenty-four Wistar male rats were divided into four groups of six each: a control
      group given distilled water (0.5 mL/100 g b.w.; i.p.), a group injected with
      Li2CO3 (25 mg/kg b.w.; i.p.; corresponding to 30% of the LD50) twice daily for 30
      days, a group receiving only CCE at 100 mg/kg of b.w. for 60 days and then
      injected with distilled water during the last 30 days of CCE treatment, and a
      group receiving CCE and then injected with Li2CO3 during the last 30 days of CCE 
      treatment. The bioactive components containing the CCE were identified using
      chemical assays. RESULTS: Treatment with Li2CO3 caused a significant change of
      some haematological parameters including red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells
      (WBC), haemoglobin content (Hb), haematocrit (Ht) and mean corpuscular volume
      (VCM) compared to the control group. Moreover, significant increases in the
      levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and of aspartate aminotransferase
      (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were observed in the blood of Li2CO3-treated rats.
      Furthermore, exposure to Li2CO3 significantly increased the LPO level and
      decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase
      (GPx) activities in the hepatic tissues. CONCLUSION: CCE possesses a significant 
      hepatoprotective effect.

TI  - Hypoglycemic Effect of Opuntia ficus-indica var. saboten Is Due to Enhanced
      Peripheral Glucose Uptake through Activation of AMPK/p38 MAPK Pathway.
LID - E800 [pii]
AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica var. saboten (OFS) has been used in traditional medicine for
      centuries to treat several illnesses, including diabetes. However, detailed
      mechanisms underlying hypoglycemic effects remain unclear. In this study, the
      mechanism underlying the hypoglycemic activity of OFS was evaluated using in
      vitro and in vivo systems. OFS treatment inhibited alpha-glucosidase activity and
      intestinal glucose absorption assessed by Na(+)-dependent glucose uptake using
      brush border membrane vesicles. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is widely
      recognized as an important regulator of glucose transport in skeletal muscle, and
      p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been proposed to be a component
      of AMPK-mediated signaling. In the present study, OFS dose-dependently increased 
      glucose uptake in L6 muscle cells. The AMPK and p38 MAPK phosphorylations were
      stimulated by OFS, and inhibitors of AMPK (compound C) and p38 MAPK (SB203580)
      abolished the effects of OFS. Furthermore, OFS increased glucose transporter 4
      (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane. OFS administration (1 g/kg and 2
      g/kg body weight) in db/db mice dose-dependently ameliorated hyperglycemia,
      hyperinsulinemia, and glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance assessed by
      homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and quantitative insulin
      sensitivity check index were also dose-dependently improved with OFS treatment.
      OFS administration improved pancreatic function through increased beta-cell mass 
      in db/db mice. These findings suggest that OFS acts by inhibiting glucose
      absorption from the intestine and enhancing glucose uptake from insulin-sensitive
      muscle cells through the AMPK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway.

      models of neurodegenerative proteinopathies.

AB  - A signature feature of age-related neurodegenerative proteinopathies is the
      misfolding and aggregation of proteins, typically amyloid-beta (Abeta) in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in Parkinson's disease
      (PD), into soluble oligomeric structures that are highly neurotoxic. Cellular and
      animal models that faithfully replicate the hallmark features of these disorders 
      are being increasing exploited to identify disease-modifying compounds. Natural
      compounds have been identified as a useful source of bioactive molecules with
      promising neuroprotective capabilities. In the present report, we investigated
      whether extracts derived from two ubiquitous Mediterranean plants namely, the
      prickly pear Opuntia ficus-indica (EOFI) and the brown alga Padina pavonica (EPP)
      alleviate neurodegenerative phenotypes in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and
      fly (Drosophila melanogaster) models of AD and PD. Pre-treatment with EPP or EOFI
      in the culture medium significantly improved the viability of yeast expressing
      the Arctic Abeta42 (E22G) mutant. Supplementing food with EOFI or EPP
      dramatically ameliorated lifespan and behavioural signs of flies with
      brain-specific expression of wild-type Abeta42 (model of late-onset AD) or the
      Arctic Abeta42 variant (model of early-onset AD). Additionally, we show that
      either extract prolonged the survival of a PD fly model based on transgenic
      expression of the human alpha-syn A53T mutant. Taken together, our findings
      suggest that the plant-derived extracts interfere with shared mechanisms of
      neurodegeneration in AD and PD. This notion is strengthened by evidence
      demonstrating that EOFI and to a greater extent EPP, while strongly inhibiting
      the fibrillogenesis of both Abeta42 and alpha-syn, accumulate remodelled
      oligomeric aggregates that are less effective at disrupting lipid membrane
      integrity. Our work therefore opens new avenues for developing therapeutic
      applications of these natural plant extracts in the treatment of amyloidogenic
      neurodegenerative disorders.

      Activities.
LID - E1612 [pii]
AB  - Use of natural polysaccharides in medicine and food has wide interest in
      research. In this study, we extracted and purified some polysaccharides from
      cactus Opuntia dillenii Haw. (ODP). Some preliminary functions of these products 
      were characterized. Under the optimal purification conditions, the yield of ODP
      extracted from the 2-4 month-old Opuntia dillenii Haw. (T-ODP) was 30.60% +/-
      0.40%, higher than that of ODP from the 5-10 month-old materials (O-ODP) (18.97% 
      +/- 0.58%). The extracted ODP was purified by DEAE sepharose fast flow anion
      exchange and Sephacryl S-400 chromatography with four fractions obtained (ODP-Ia,
      ODP-Ib, ODP-IIa and ODP-IIb). Analysis with UV-vis chromatography indicated that 
      ODP-Ia and ODP-IIa were relatively homogeneous molecules with a molecular weight 
      of 339 kD and 943 kD, respectively. Results of infrared spectroscopy indicated
      that ODP, ODP-Ia, and ODP-IIa were acidic polysaccharides. Further, the
      antioxidant activity against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical,
      hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide radical in vitro demonstrated that the T-ODP
      exhibited higher antioxidant activity than the O-ODP, and the purified fraction
      (ODP-Ia) was superior to the ODP. These results will offer a theoretical basis
      for further research on the structure-function relationship of ODP and the
      rational utilization of Opuntia dillenii Haw.

AB  - Two different plants namely Phoenix canariensis and Opuntia ficus-indica were
      used as substrate for reducing sugar generation and ethanol production. Dilute
      acid, alkaline and steam explosion were used as pretreatment methods in order to 
      depolymerize lignin and/or hemicellulose and recover cellulose. By using alkaline
      pretreatment with 2.5% NaOH 71.08% for P. canariensis and 74.61% for O.
      ficus-indica lignin removal and 81.84% for P. canariensis and 72.66% for O.
      ficus-indica cellulose recovery yields were obtained. Pretreated materials were
      hydrolyzed by cellulase with high efficiency (87.0% and 84.5% cellulose
      conversion yields for P. canariensis and O. ficus-indica) and used as substrate
      for fermentation. Maximum ethanol production of 15.75g/L and 14.71g/L were
      achieved from P. canariensis and O. ficus-indica respectively. Structural
      differences were observed by XRD, FTIR and SEM for untreated, pretreated,
      hydrolyzed and fermented samples and were highly correlated with compositional
      analysis results.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of a Natural Remedy for the Treatment of Gastroesophageal
      Reflux: A Double-Blinded Randomized-Controlled Study.
PG  - 2581461
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a common, chronic, relapsing symptom. Often
      people self-diagnose and self-treat it even though health-related quality of life
      is significantly impaired. In the lack of a valid alternative approach, current
      treatments focus on suppression of gastric acid secretion by the use of proton
      pump inhibitors (PPIs), but people with GER have a significantly lower response
      rate to therapy. We designed a randomized double-blinded controlled clinical
      study to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a formulation based on sodium
      alginate/bicarbonate in combination with extracts obtained from Opuntia
      ficus-indica and Olea europaea associated with polyphenols (Mucosave(R); verum), 
      on GER-related symptoms. Male/female 118 (intention to treat) subjects with
      moderate GER and having at least 2 to 6 days of GER episodes/week were treated
      with verum (6 g/day) or placebo for two months. The questionnaires
      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQoL) and
      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Symptom Assessment Scale (GSAS) were
      self-administered by participants before the treatment and at the end of the
      treatment. Verum produced statistically significant reduction of GERD-HRQoL and
      GSAS scores, -56.5% and -59.1%, respectively, in comparison to placebo. Heartburn
      and acid regurgitation episodes for week were significantly reduced by verum (p <
      0.01). Results indicate that Mucosave formulation provides an effective and
      well-tolerated treatment for reducing the frequency and intensity of symptoms
      associated with gastroesophageal reflux.

AB  - The contamination of edible leafy vegetables by atmospheric heavy metal-bearing
      particles is a major issue in environmental toxicology. In this study, the uptake
      of lead by cladodes of Opuntia ficus-indica (Ofi), traditionally used in Mexican 
      cuisine and in livestock fodder, is investigated after a 4-months exposure of
      either cladodes or roots to synthetic Pb-fluorapatite particles. Atomic
      Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) for the quantitative analysis of Pb levels,
      Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy
      (SEM-EDX) for the examination of the cladode surface and fate of particles, and
      Micro-X-ray fluorescence (muXRF) measurements for elemental mapping of Pb in
      cladodes, were used. The results evidence that foliar contamination may be a
      major pathway for the transfer of Pb within Ofi cladodes. The stomata, areoles,
      and cuticle of cladode surface, play an obvious role in the retention and the
      incorporation of lead-bearing apatite, thus revealing the hazard of eating
      contaminated cladodes. The possibility of using series of successive cladodes for
      biomonitoring the atmospheric pollution in arid and semi-arid regions is also
      rapidly discussed.

AB  - The present study aimed to assess the phenolic composition of the acetone extract
      from Opuntia ficus indica cladodes (ACTEX) and its effects on ram semen
      variables, lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation during liquid storage at 5
      degrees C for up to 72h in skim milk and Tris egg yolk extenders. Semen samples
      from five rams were pooled extended with Tris-egg yolk (TEY) or skim milk (SM)
      extenders containing ACTEX (0%, 1%, 2%, 4% and 8%) at a final concentration of
      0.8x10(9) sperm/ml and stored for up to 72h at 5 degrees C. The sperm variables
      were evaluated at different time periods (8, 24, 48 and 72h). Sperm total
      motility and viability were superior in TEY than in SM whereas the progressive
      motility, membrane integrity, abnormality and spontaneous lipid peroxidation were
      greater in SM compared to TEY (P<0.05). The results also indicated that the
      inclusion of 1% ACTEX in the SM or TEY extender increased the sperm motility,
      viability, membrane integrity, and decreased the abnormality, lipids peroxidation
      up to 72h in storage compared to control group. Similarly, even at 72h of
      storage, 1% ACTEX can efficiently decrease the negative effects of liquid storage
      on sperm DNA fragmentation (P<0.05). In conclusion, SM and TEY supplemented with 
      1% of ACTEX can improve the quality of ram semen. Further studies are required to
      identify the active components in ACTEX involved in its effect on ram sperm
      preservation.

TI  - Hepatoprotective Effect of Opuntia robusta and Opuntia streptacantha Fruits
      against Acetaminophen-Induced Acute Liver Damage.
LID - E607 [pii]
AB  - Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver failure (ALF) is a serious health
      problem in developed countries. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), the current therapy
      for APAP-induced ALF, is not always effective, and liver transplantation is often
      needed. Opuntia spp. fruits are an important source of nutrients and contain high
      levels of bioactive compounds, including antioxidants. The aim of this study was 
      to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of Opuntia robusta and Opuntia
      streptacantha extracts against APAP-induced ALF. In addition, we analyzed the
      antioxidant activities of these extracts. Fruit extracts (800mg/kg/day, orally)
      were given prophylactically to male Wistar rats before intoxication with APAP
      (500 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Rat hepatocyte cultures were exposed to
      20mmol/LAPAP, and necrosis was assessed by LDH leakage. Opuntia robusta had signi
      fi cantly higher levels of antioxidants than Opuntia streptacantha. Both extracts
      signi fi cantly attenuated APAP-induced injury markers AST, ALT and ALP and
      improved liver histology. The Opuntia extracts reversed APAP-induced depletion of
      liver GSH and glycogen stores. In cultured hepatocytes, Opuntia extracts signi fi
      cantly reduced leakage of LDH and cell necrosis, both prophylactically and
      therapeutically. Both extracts appeared to be superior to NAC when used
      therapeutically. We conclude that Opuntia extracts are hepatoprotective and can
      be used as a nutraceutical to prevent ALF.

TI  - Fruit vinegars attenuate cardiac injury via anti-inflammatory and anti-adiposity 
      actions in high-fat diet-induced obese rats.
PG  - 43-52
AB  - CONTEXT: Fruit vinegars (FVs) are used in Mediterranean folk medicine for their
      hypolipidemic and weight-reducing properties. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the
      preventive effects of three types of FV, commonly available in Algeria, namely
      prickly pear [Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill (Cectaceae)], pomegranate [Punica
      granatum L. (Punicaceae)], and apple [Malus domestica Borkh. (Rosaceae)], against
      obesity-induced cardiomyopathy and its underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Seventy-two male Wistar rats were equally divided into 12 groups. The
      first group served as normal control (distilled water, 7 mL/kg bw), and the
      remaining groups were respectively treated with distilled water (7 mL/kg bw),
      acetic acid (0.5% w/v, 7 mL/kg bw) and vinegars of pomegranate, apple or prickly 
      pear (at doses of 3.5, 7 and 14 mL/kg bw, acetic acid content as mentioned above)
      along with a high-fat diet (HFD). The effects of the oral administration of FV
      for 18 weeks on the body and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) weights, plasma
      inflammatory and cardiac enzymes biomarkers, and in heart tissue were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: Vinegars treatments significantly (p < .05) attenuated the HFD-induced
      increase in bw (0.2-0.5-fold) and VAT mass (0.7-1.8-fold), as well as increase in
      plasma levels of CRP (0.1-0.3-fold), fibrinogen (0.2-0.3-fold), leptin
      (1.7-3.7-fold), TNF-alpha (0.1-0.6-fold), AST (0.9-1.4-fold), CK-MB
      (0.3-1.4-fold) and LDH (2.7-6.7-fold). Moreover, vinegar treatments preserved
      myocardial architecture and attenuated cardiac fibrosis. DISCUSSION AND
      CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that pomegranate, apple and prickly pear
      vinegars may prevent HFD-induced obesity and obesity-related cardiac
      complications, and that this prevention may result from the potent
      anti-inflammatory and anti-adiposity properties of these vinegars.

TI  - Assessing the herbivore role of the sea-urchin Echinometra viridis: Keys to
      determine the structure of communities in disturbed coral reefs.

AB  - Echinometra viridis previously was considered a cryptic species unable to control
      the development and growth of macroalgae on coral reefs. Its role as a herbivore 
      was seen as minor compared to other grazers present on the reef. However, the
      present disturbed state of some reefs has highlighted the role played by this
      sea-urchin. Combining field data with experiments on the Caribbean coast of
      Panama, we demonstrate that the current community organization on disturbed coral
      reefs in the Mesoamerican Caribbean is largely due to the action of E. viridis.
      It is the most abundant sea-urchin species, together with two others (Diadema
      antillarum and Echinometra lucunter). Field data also indicate that the
      relationship between its density and the abundance of macroalgae is stronger and 
      it is more negative in impact than those of the other two. However, the niche
      this urchin exploits most efficiently is confined to leeward reefs with low
      levels of sedimentation. Outside these habitats, their populations are not
      decisive in controlling macroalgal growth. Grazing experiments showed that E.
      viridis consumes more fresh macroalgae per day and per weight of sea-urchin, and 
      is a more effective grazer than D. antillarum or E. lucunter. E. viridis showed
      food preferences for early-successional turf macroalgae (Acanthophora spicifera),
      avoiding the less palatable late-successional and fleshy macroalgae (Lobophora
      variegata, Halimeda opuntia). However, it becomes a generalist herbivore feeding 
      on all varieties of macroalgae when resources are scarce. H. opuntia is the
      macroalga that most resists E. viridis activity, which may explain its wide
      distribution.

TI  - Adult nutrition, but not inbreeding, affects male primary sexual traits in the
      leaf-footed cactus bug Narnia femorata (Hemiptera: Coreidae).
PG  - 4792-9
LID - 10.1002/ece3.2246 [doi]
AB  - Adverse conditions may be the norm rather than the exception in natural
      populations. Many populations experience poor nutrition on a seasonal basis.
      Further, brief interludes of inbreeding can be common as population density
      fluctuates and because of habitat fragmentation. Here, we investigated the
      effects of poor nutrition and inbreeding on traits that can be very important to 
      reproductive success and fitness in males: testes mass, sperm concentration, and 
      sperm viability. Our study species was Narnia femorata, a species introduced to
      north-central Florida in the 1950s. This species encounters regular, seasonal
      changes in diet that can have profound phenotypic effects on morphology and
      behavior. We generated inbred and outbred individuals through a single generation
      of full-sibling mating or outcrossing, respectively. All juveniles were provided 
      a natural, high-quality diet of Opuntia humifusa cactus cladode with fruit until 
      they reached adulthood. New adult males were put on a high- or low-quality diet
      for at least 21 days before measurements were taken. As expected, the low-quality
      diet led to significantly decreased testes mass in both inbred and outbred males,
      although there were surprisingly no detectable effects on sperm traits. We did
      not find evidence that inbreeding affected testes mass, sperm concentration, and 
      sperm viability. Our results highlight the immediate and overwhelming effects of 
      nutrition on testes mass, while suggesting that a single generation of inbreeding
      might not be detrimental for primary sexual traits in this particular population.

TI  - Microscale Mechanism of Age Dependent Wetting Properties of Prickly Pear Cacti
      (Opuntia).
PG  - 9335-41
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b02173 [doi]
AB  - Cacti thrive in xeric environments through specialized water storage and
      collection tactics such as a shallow, widespread root system that maximizes
      rainwater absorption and spines adapted for fog droplet collection. However, in
      many cacti, the epidermis, not the spines, dominates the exterior surface area.
      Yet, little attention has been dedicated to studying interactions of the cactus
      epidermis with water drops. Surprisingly, the epidermis of plants in the genus
      Opuntia, also known as prickly pear cacti, has water-repelling characteristics.
      In this work, we report that surface properties of cladodes of 25 taxa of Opuntia
      grown in an arid Sonoran climate switch from water-repelling to superwetting
      under water impact over the span of a single season. We show that the old cladode
      surfaces are not superhydrophilic, but have nearly vanishing receding contact
      angle. We study water drop interactions with, as well as nano/microscale topology
      and chemistry of, the new and old cladodes of two Opuntia species and use this
      information to uncover the microscopic mechanism underlying this phenomenon. We
      demonstrate that composition of extracted wax and its contact angle do not change
      significantly with time. Instead, we show that the reported age dependent wetting
      behavior primarily stems from pinning of the receding contact line along
      multilayer surface microcracks in the epicuticular wax that expose the underlying
      highly hydrophilic layers.

AB  - This study describes the in vitro anthelmintic activity of extracts from Opuntia 
      ficus indica against gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep. The anthelmintic
      activity was evaluated by inhibition of egg hatching, larval development and
      larval migration assays. The residual aqueous fractions from cladodes and fruits 
      showed higher ovicidal activity with EC50 values of 7.2mg/mL and 1.5mg/mL,
      respectively. The aqueous, hexane, and ethyl acetate fractions from fruits and
      the aqueous fraction from cladodes inhibited 100% of larval development at the
      lowest concentration tested (1.56mg/mL). The crude cladode and fruit ethanolic
      extracts inhibited larval migration and showed EC50 values of 0.74mg/mL and
      0.27mg/mL, respectively. Phytochemical screening detected high concentrations of 
      alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, and saponins in the fruits and cladodes. The
      results demonstrated that O. ficus exhibits anthelmintic activity in vitro,
      suggesting that, beyond its nutritional potential, this plant can also be an ally
      for parasite control in sheep.

TI  - Rheological Flow Behavior of Structural Polysaccharides from Edible Tender
      Cladodes of Wild, Semidomesticated and Cultivated 'Nopal' (Opuntia) of Mexican
      Highlands.
PG  - 388-395
AB  - The aim of this study was to quantify the content of polysaccharides of edible
      tender cladodes (nopalitos) of three species of Opuntia and to evaluate the
      rheological flow behavior of isolated polysaccharides. A completely randomized
      experimental design was used to characterize a wild (O. streptacantha), a
      semidomesticated (O. megacantha) and a domesticated (O. ficus-indica) species.
      Mucilage content was higher (4.93 to 12.43 g 100 g(-1) dry matter), tightly bound
      hemicelluloses were lower (3.32 to 1.81 g 100 g(-1) dry matter) and pectins and
      loosely bound hemicelluloses were not different in wild than in domesticated
      species. Aqueous solution/suspensions of mucilage, pectins, hemicellulose and
      cellulose of all species showed non-Newtonian behavior under simple shear flow.
      The flow behavior of the structural polysaccharides was well described by the
      Ostwald de-Waele model. Pectins and mucilages exhibited the highest consistency
      indexes (K values ranged from 0.075 to 0.177 Pas(n)) with a moderated
      shear-thinning behavior (n values ranged from 0.53 to 0.67). Cellulose
      dispersions exhibited the most shear-thinning behavior (n values ranged from 0.17
      to 0.41) and hemicelluloses showed a tendency to Newtonian flow (n values ranged 
      from 0.82 to 0.97). The rheological flow properties of these polysaccharides may 
      be useful to improve the textural and sensory qualities of some foods and
      pharmaceutical materials. Moreover, they can emerge as functional ingredients
      mainly due to the nutraceutical properties that have been attributed to
      nopalitos.

AB  - High-throughput transcriptome studies are breaking new ground to investigate the 
      responses that organisms deploy in alternative environments. Nevertheless, much
      remains to be understood about the genetic basis of host plant adaptation. Here, 
      we investigate genome-wide expression in the fly Drosophila buzzatii raised in
      different conditions. This species uses decaying tissues of cactus of the genus
      Opuntia as primary rearing substrate and secondarily, the necrotic tissues of the
      columnar cactus Trichocereus terscheckii. The latter constitutes a harmful host, 
      rich in mescaline and other related phenylethylamine alkaloids. We assessed the
      transcriptomic responses of larvae reared in Opuntia sulphurea and T.
      terscheckii, with and without the addition of alkaloids extracted from the
      latter. Whole-genome expression profiles were massively modulated by the rearing 
      environment, mainly by the presence of T. terscheckii alkaloids. Differentially
      expressed genes were mainly related to detoxification, oxidation-reduction and
      stress response; however, we also found genes involved in development and
      neurobiological processes. In conclusion, our study contributes new data onto the
      role of transcriptional plasticity in response to alternative rearing
      environments.

AB  - In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize
      microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) technology of mucilage polysaccharide from
      the peel of Opuntia dillenii haw. fruits (OFPP), and the physicochemical
      characteristics of OFPP were also investigated. The three parameters were the
      ratio of water to raw material (30-40ml/g), microwave power (300-400W) and
      extraction time (120-180s). The results indicated that the yield of OFPP was
      15.62+/-0.37% under the optimum extraction conditions. Compared with MAE, the
      OFPP yield by hot water extraction (HWE) was 13.36+/-0.71%. In addition, the
      rheological properties of OFPP were also explored. The OFPP obtained by HWE
      exhibited a lower viscosity compared with that by MAE. The FT-IR spectra
      analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation and thermogravimetric
      analysis (TGA) revealed that there were strong interactions between Ca(2+) and
      OFPP, which resulted in the high viscosity, different microstructure and thermal 
      stability of OFPP.

TI  - Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Activity of Methanolic Plant Extracts against
      Nosocomial Microorganisms.
PG  - 1572697
LID - 10.1155/2016/1572697 [doi]
AB  - Biofilm is a complex microbial community highly resistant to antimicrobials. The 
      formation of biofilms in biotic and abiotic surfaces is associated with high
      rates of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. New alternatives for
      controlling infections have been proposed focusing on the therapeutic properties 
      of medicinal plants and their antimicrobial effects. In the present study the
      antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of 8 methanolic plant extracts were
      evaluated against clinical isolated microorganisms. Preliminary screening by
      diffusion well assay showed the antimicrobial activity of Prosopis laevigata,
      Opuntia ficus-indica, and Gutierrezia microcephala. The minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined 
      ranging from 0.7 to >15 mg/mL. The specific biofilm formation index (SBF) was
      evaluated before and after the addition of plant extracts (MBC x 0.75). Opuntia
      ficus-indica caused the major reduction on SBF in dose-dependent manner.
      Cytotoxic activity of plant extracts was determined using brine shrimp lethality 
      test (Artemia salina L.). Lethal Dose concentration (LD50 values) of the plant
      extracts was calculated. LD50 values for P. laevigata and G. microcephala were
      141.6 and 323.3 microg/mL, respectively, while O. ficus-indica showed a slight
      lethality with 939.2 microg/mL. Phytochemical analyses reveal the presence of
      flavonoids, tannins, and coumarines.

AB  - The chemical extraction and the characterization of polysaccharides from mucilage
      (MC), pectin (PC) and total pectic mucilage fraction (TFC) of Opuntia ficus
      indica cladodes as well as the evaluation of their antioxidant activities was
      investigated. The FTIR spectroscopic analysis revealed the presence of carboxyl
      and hydroxyl groups corresponding to polysaccharides. Uronic acid and the total
      sugar contents of PC were higher than those of TFC and MC whereas ash content of 
      MC was considerably more important. In addition, the findings showed that all the
      samples had little protein content and low average molecular weight compared to
      the results mentioned in literature. Furthermore, MC reached not only the highest
      water (WHC) and oil holding (OHC) capacities (7.81g/g and 1.34g/g, respectively) 
      but also the highest antioxidant properties (DPPH and ABTS scavenging activities,
      beta-carotene bleaching inhibition activity and reducing power). However, PC had 
      the strongest emulsifying and foaming properties. As for TFC, it had low WHC, OHC
      and emulsifying properties whereas it had higher foaming properties than MC and
      greater antioxidant properties compared to PC. These outcomes can encourage the
      use of PC as a surfactant and MC and TFC as natural antioxidants in food and
      pharmaceutical industries.

AB  - Strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified from raw prickly pear
      (Opuntia ficus-indica L.). Five autochthonous strains were selected based on the 
      kinetics of growth and acidification on prickly pear fruit juice, and the
      capacity to synthesize exo-polysaccharides. All selected Leuc. mesenteroides
      strains showed an in vitro mucilage-degrading capability. A protocol for
      processing and storage of fermented prickly pear fruit puree (FP) was set up.
      Unstarted FP and chemically acidified FP were used as the controls. Starters grew
      and remained viable at elevated cell numbers during 21 days of storage at 4
      degrees C. Contaminating Enterobacteriaceae and yeasts were found only in the
      controls. Viscosity and serum separation distinguished started FP compared to the
      controls. Colour parameters, browning index, sensory attributes, antimicrobial
      activity, vitamin C and betalains levels were positively affected by lactic acid 
      fermentation. Increase of free radical scavenging activity in ethyl acetate
      soluble extract suggested an effect of selected strains on phenolic profiles.
      Started FP markedly inhibited the inflammatory status of Caco-2/TC7 cells, and
      also contributed to maintaining the integrity of tight junctions. Started FP
      scavenged the reactive oxygen species generated by H2O2 on Caco-2 cells. All
      selected strain variously affected the immunomodulatory activity towards anti-

TI  - Genetic divergence between Mexican Opuntia accessions inferred by polymerase
      chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.

AB  - Molecular methods are powerful tools in characterizing and determining
      relationships between plants. The aim of this study was to study genetic
      divergence between 103 accessions of Mexican Opuntia. To accomplish this,
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis
      of three chloroplast intergenic spacers (atpB-rbcL, trnL-trnF, and psbA-trnH),
      one chloroplast gene (ycf1), two nuclear genes (ppc and PhyC), and one
      mitochondrial gene (cox3) was conducted. The amplified products from all the
      samples had very similar molecular sizes, and there were only very small
      differences between the undigested PCR amplicons for all regions, with the
      exception of ppc. We obtained 5850 bp from the seven regions, and 136 fragments
      were detected with eight enzymes, 37 of which (27.2%) were polymorphic. We found 
      that 40% of the fragments from the chloroplast regions were polymorphic, 9.8% of 
      the bands detected in the nuclear genes were polymorphic, and 20% of the bands in
      the mitochondrial locus were polymorphic. trnL-trnF and psbA-trnH were the most
      variable regions. The Nei and Li/Dice distance was very short, and ranged from 0 
      to 0.12; indeed, 77 of the 103 genotypes had the same genetic profile. All the
      xoconostle accessions (acidic fruits) were grouped together without being
      separated from three genotypes of prickly pear (sweet fruits). We assume that the
      genetic divergence between prickly pears and xoconostles is very low, and
      question the number of Opuntia species currently considered in Mexico.

AB  - Physicochemical and physiological ripening events in cactus pear (Opuntia
      ficus-indica) fruit of cultivars 'Ntopia' and 'Hercules' were profiled against
      skin coloration from mature-green (S1) to over-mature (S5). Fructose and glucose 
      accumulation were linear in 'Ntopia' but peaked near S3 in 'Hercules'
      synchronously to the appearance of sucrose. Betalains increased steadily in
      'Ntopia' (103.2mg/l) but peaked before full skin coloration in 'Hercules'
      (49.7mg/l); whereas phenolic content remained invariable and ascorbate content
      peaked near S5 in both 'Ntopia' (108.6mug/g) and 'Hercules' (163.1mug/g). Cell
      wall material diminished with maturity though textural changes with ripening
      appeared not related to pectin solubilization but to weakening of glycan bonding 
      and loss of neutral sugars. Fruit firmness rather was correlated to seed weight
      (r=0.89) and seed-to-pulp ratio (r=0.73). Cultivar differences highlighted in the
      chronology of ripening events are critical for defining optimum harvest maturity 
      and postharvest handling protocols for premium quality cactus pear fruit.

AB  - The use of cactus is an alternative for sustainable production systems in
      Northeast Brazil. The objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of
      supplying five cacti species from the Brazilian semi-arid northeast region on the
      physical-chemical sensory characteristics and the profile of fatty acids of
      Saanen goat milk. Five multiparous goats were used, confined, and distributed in 
      a Latin square 5 x 5 design, with five experimental diets and five periods.
      Treatments consisted of 473 to 501 g/kg of a cactaceous mix (Pilosocereus
      gounellei, Cereus jamacaru, Cereus squamosus, Nopalea cochenillifera, or Opuntia 
      stricta) added to 187.8 to 197.9 g/kg of "Sabia" (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia) hay
      and 311 to 329 g/kg of concentrate. No effects of experimental diets (P > 0.05)
      were evidenced in the physical and chemical composition of milk for fat, total
      solids, or salt levels. However, protein, lactose, solids-not-fat levels, and
      cryoscopy point were influenced by diet (P < 0.05). There was no significant
      difference (P > 0.05) in the profile of fatty acids between treatments for all
      acids found, except for butyric acid. Diets also did not (P > 0.05) confer
      sensory changes in milk characteristics. The use of the native cacti in the dairy
      goats' diet did not influence the sensory characteristics or lipid profile of
      milk.

AB  - Opuntia spp. fruits are considered as health promoting foods due to the diversity
      of bioactive molecules found in these fruits. The composition in organic acids,
      flavonols and betalains in the Opuntia ficus-indica juice from a region of
      Portugal was accomplished for the first time by liquid chromatography and tandem 
      mass spectrometry using an electrospray ionization source operating in negative
      and positive mode. The methodology used allowed the detection of 44 compounds,
      from which 32 were identified. Isorhamnetin derivatives were the dominant
      flavonol glycosides. A total of 9 betalains including 6 betaxanthins and 3
      betacyanin were also detected in the fruit juice samples and indicaxanthin,
      betanin and isobetanin were the major pigments. Phenolic acid and phenylpyruvic
      acid derivatives were also identified. To our knowledge, it is the first time
      derivative compounds from piscidic acid, phenolic compounds and betalains are
      characterized in cactus pear juice using a single LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS method.

AB  - Selected technological characteristics and bioactive compounds of juice pressed
      directly from the mash of whole Opuntia dillenii cactus fruits have been
      investigated. The impact of pulsed electric fields (PEF) for a non-thermal
      disintegration on the important juice characteristics has been evaluated in
      comparison to microwave heating and use of pectinases. Results showed that the
      cactus juice exhibited desirable technological characteristics. Besides, it also 
      contained a high amount of phenolic compounds being the major contributors to the
      overall antioxidant activity of juice. HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS(n) measurements in the
      fruits' peel and pulp showed that isorhamnetin 3-O-rutinoside was determined as
      the single flavonol found only in the fruit's peel. Treating fruit mash with a
      moderate electric field strength increased juice yield and improved juice
      characteristics. Promisingly, the highest release of isorhamnetin 3-O-rutinoside 
      from fruit's peel into juice was maximally achieved by PEF.

TI  - First Report of the Carolina Spiral Nematode, Scutellonema brachyurus, from Soil 
      of a Garden in Crete, Greece.
PG  - 7
AB  - Members of the genus Scutellonema can cause substantial crop losses to ornamental
      and cultivated plants directly by feeding ectoparasitically on plant roots
      (Bridge et al., 2005; Coyne et al., 2006). In May 2015, a soil sample from a
      house garden from Heraklion city in Crete, Greece, was sent for diagnosis of
      plant-parasitic nematodes. In this place, there had been cactus (Opuntia sp.)
      plants (probably imported), which were uprooted 3 to 4 years earlier. After that,
      the area was cropped with cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) in spring-summer and leaf
      vegetables such as spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and chicory (Cichorium intybus 
      L.) in autumn-winter. The soil was collected 1 mon after the end of chicory crop.
      A population density (ca. 30 individuals/100 cm(3) of soil) of spiral nematodes
      (Scutellonema sp.) was found by extracting soil with the wet sieving and
      decanting method (Cobb, 1918). Morphological and molecular analyses of females
      identified the species as Scutellonema brachyurus (Steiner, 1938) Andrassy, 1958.
      The morphology of females was characterized by a hemispherical lip region with
      four to six annuli, morphometric data for 12 females were L, 640 to 760 mum; a,
      24.6 to 30.6; b, 5.8 to 7.4; c, 69.1 to 99.3; c 0.5 to 0.6; stylet, 24.5 to 27.5 
      mum with anterior part shorter than posterior; and spermatheca nonfunctional and 
      male absent. The morphology agreed with the description of S. brachyurus (van den
      Berg et al., 2013). Alignment indicated that the D2-D3 and ITS sequences
      (KU059494 and KU059495, respectively) showed 99% and 100% to 99% similarity,
      respectively, to other sequences of S. brachyurus (type A) deposited in GenBank
      from the United States, Italy, and Korea (JX472037-JX472046, DQ328753, FJ485643; 
      and JX472069, JX472070, JX472071, respectively), differing from one to six
      nucleotides. Phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian inference of these sequences
      placed the Scutellonema sp. in a highly supported (100%) clade that included all 
      S. brachyurus (type A) sequences deposited in GenBank (van den Berg et al.,
      2013). All identification methods were consistent with S. brachyurus. To our
      knowledge, this is the first report of S. brachyurus for Greece. As the cucumbers
      and the leaf vegetables cultivated in the area were seed planted, we consider
      that the nematode originated most probably from the cactus plants which had been 
      previously root ball planted. Scutellonema brachyurus may represent a threat for 
      ornamental and cultivated plants production in Crete, Greece. The nematode has
      been already reported, mainly in greenhouses of six European countries (CABI and 
      EPPO, 2006). In most of these cases, it is hypothesized that the nematode was
      introduced by imported plant material.

TI  - Seed oil extraction from red prickly pear using hexane and supercritical CO2 :
      assessment of phenolic compound composition, antioxidant and antibacterial
      activities.
PG  - 613-620
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.7774 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Investigating Opuntia species for their seed oil content is of much
      importance owing to their potential use for food and in cosmetic applications.
      These oils have an important content in unsaturated fatty acids as well as
      antioxidant compounds (e.g. polyphenols, vitamin E), which have been associated
      with the prevention of some chronic diseases. Moreover, Opuntia stricta oils
      possess important antimicrobial activities. For instance, the main focus of this 
      study was to compare the effectiveness of conventional (hexane extraction) and
      novel (supercritical (SC)-CO2 ) extraction methods for the recovery of oil and
      phenolic compounds from O. stricta seeds. The oil yield of both extracts was then
      compared and the polyphenol content and composition of both extracts were
      determined by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry.
      Additionally, antioxidant (DPPH assay) and antimicrobial activities (disc
      diffusion method) of O. stricta seed oils were determined. RESULTS: The oil yield
      (based on Soxhlet's method) of O. stricta seeds was determined using SC-CO2 (49.9
      +/- 2.2%), and hexane (49.0 +/- 1.5%). Although obtaining similar oil extraction 
      yields using the two methods, the extracted oil using SC-CO2 was more enriched in
      polyphenols (172.2 +/- 11.9 microg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) g(-1) oil) than 
      that extracted using hexane (76.0 +/- 6.9 microg GAE g(-1) of oil). Polyphenol
      profiles showed that the SC-CO2 process led to the yield of more compounds (45)
      than that using hexane extraction (11). Moreover, the antioxidant and
      antimicrobial activities of SC-CO2 extract showed a high percentage of
      inhibition. CONCLUSION: SC-CO2 extraction of O. stricta seed oil led to
      extraction of oil with a similar yield to that with hexane extraction, but with
      higher polyphenol content. The extract containing polyphenols exhibited high
      antioxidant and antibacterial properties, demonstrating their great potential as 
      feedstock for high-oil quality. (c) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The Opuntia genus is widely distributed in America, but the highest
      richness of wild species are found in Mexico, as well as the most domesticated
      Opuntia ficus-indica, which is the most domesticated species and an important
      crop in agricultural economies of arid and semiarid areas worldwide. During
      domestication process, the Opuntia morphological characteristics were favored,
      such as less and smaller spines in cladodes and less seeds in fruits, but changes
      at molecular level are almost unknown. To obtain more insights about the Opuntia 
      molecular changes through domestication, a shotgun proteomic analysis and
      database-dependent searches by homology was carried out. >1000 protein species
      were identified and by using a label-free quantitation method, the Opuntia
      proteomes were compared in order to identify differentially accumulated proteins 
      among wild and domesticated species. Most of the changes were observed in
      glucose, secondary, and 1C metabolism, which correlate with the observed protein,
      fiber and phenolic compounds accumulation in Opuntia cladodes. Regulatory
      proteins, ribosomal proteins, and proteins related with response to stress were
      also observed in differential accumulation. These results provide new valuable
      data that will help to the understanding of the molecular changes of Opuntia
      species through domestication. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Opuntia species are well 
      adapted to dry and warm conditions in arid and semiarid regions worldwide, and
      they are highly productive plants showing considerable promises as an alternative
      food source. However, there is a gap regarding Opuntia molecular mechanisms that 
      enable them to grow in extreme environmental conditions and how the domestication
      processes has changed them. In the present study, a shotgun analysis was carried 
      out to characterize the proteomes of five Opuntia species selected by its
      domestication degree. Our results will help to a better understanding of
      proteomic features underlying the selection and specialization under evolution
      and domestication of Opuntia and will provide a platform for basic biology
      research and gene discovery.

      Adenocarcinoma Cells.

AB  - Opuntia humifusa (OHF) has been used as a nutraceutical source for the prevention
      of chronic diseases. In the present study, the inhibitory effects of ethyl
      acetate extracts of OHF on the proliferation of AGS human gastric cancer cells
      and the mode of action were investigated. To elucidate the antiproliferative
      mechanisms of OHF in cancer cells, the expression of genes related to apoptosis
      and cell cycle arrest were determined with real-time PCR and western blot. The
      cytotoxic effect of OHF on AGS cells was observed in a dose-dependent manner.
      Exposure to OHF (100 mug/mL) significantly induced (P<0.05) the G1 phase cell
      cycle arrest. Additionally, the apoptotic cell population was greater (P<0.05) in
      OHF (200 mug/mL) treated AGS cells when compared to the control. The expression
      of genes associated with cell cycle progression (Cdk4, Cdk2, and cyclin E) was
      significantly downregulated (P<0.05) by the OHF treatment. Moreover, the
      expression of Bax and caspase-3 in OHF treated cells was higher (P<0.05) than in 
      the control. These findings suggest that OHF induces the G1 phase cell cycle
      arrest and activation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway in AGS human
      gastric cancer cells.

      competition, density, and breeding sites.
PG  - 675-683
LID - 10.1111/1744-7917.12345 [doi]
AB  - Changes in the environmental conditions experienced by naturally occurring
      populations are frequently accompanied by changes in adaptive traits allowing the
      organism to cope with environmental unpredictability. Phenotypic plasticity is a 
      major aspect of adaptation and it has been involved in population dynamics of
      interacting species. In this study, phenotypic plasticity (i.e., environmental
      sensitivity) of morphological adaptive traits were analyzed in the cactophilic
      species Drosophila buzzatii and Drosophila koepferae (Diptera: Drosophilidae)
      considering the effect of crowding conditions (low and high density), type of
      competition (intraspecific and interspecific competition) and cacti hosts
      (Opuntia and Columnar cacti). All traits (wing length, wing width, thorax length,
      wing loading and wing aspect) showed significant variation for each environmental
      factor considered in both Drosophila species. The phenotypic plasticity pattern
      observed for each trait was different within and between these cactophilic
      Drosophila species depending on the environmental factor analyzed suggesting that
      body size-related traits respond almost independently to environmental
      heterogeneity. The effects of ecological factors analyzed in this study are
      discussed in order to elucidate the causal factors investigated (type of
      competition, crowding conditions and alternative host) affecting the election of 
      the breeding site and/or the range of distribution of these cactophilic species.

TI  - Autonomous Biological Control of Dactylopius opuntiae (Hemiptera: Dactyliiopidae)
      in a Prickly Pear Plantation With Ecological Management.
LID - nvw023 [pii]
AB  - It is broadly known that the conservation of biological diversity in agricultural
      ecosystems contributes to pest control. This process was studied in a prickly
      pear plantation (Opuntia megacanthaandOpuntia ficus-indica) located in central
      Mexico. No insecticides have been used on this plantation since 2000, and local
      farmers believe that the presence of different species of insects limits the
      growth of the wild cochineal (Dactylopius opuntiaeCockerell), which is one of the
      main pests in this crop. From August 2012 to November 2013, we estimated the
      number of cochineal per stem in the plantation and determined its spatial
      distribution pattern. In order to identify signs of population regulation, we
      obtained histograms of the frequency distribution of the size of the clusters and
      determined if distribution is adjusted to a power function (power law). We
      identified the cochineal predators and determined the correlation in their
      abundances. The greater abundance of cochineal occurred between summer and autumn
      while the minimum value was recorded in spring. The frequency distribution of the
      cochineal clusters had a high level of adjustment to a power function, suggesting
      the presence of population regulation processes. Six species that prey on
      cochineal were identified.Laetilia coccidivoraandHyperaspis trifurcatawere the
      most active and their abundance was significantly correlated with the abundance
      of cochineal. We found that the probability of extinction of these insects in a
      cladode increases with its density, since the density and predator activity also 
      increased. It is likely that, under these conditions, the cochineal have
      established an autonomous control.

TI  - Is in vitro micrografting a possible valid alternative to traditional
      micropropagation in Cactaceae? Pelecyphora aselliformis as a case study.
PG  - 201
LID - 10.1186/s40064-016-1901-6 [doi]
AB  - Several taxa of Cactaceae are endangered by overcollection for commercial
      purposes, and most of the family is included in the Convention on International
      Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES). Micropropagation may play
      a key role to keep the pressure off wild populations and contribute to ex situ
      conservation of endangered taxa. One of the limits of micropropagation is the
      species-specific requirement of plant regulators for each taxon and sometimes
      even for different genotypes. With the micrografting technique the rootstock
      directly provides the scion with the necessary hormonal requirements. In this
      paper we present data on in vitro grafting of Pelecyphora aselliformis Ehrenberg,
      an Appendix I CITES listed species critically endangered and sought after by the 
      horticultural trade, on micropropagated Opuntia ficus-indica Miller. Apical and
      sub-apical scions of P. aselliformis were used to perform micrografting with a
      successful rate of 97 and 81 % respectively. Survival rate after ex vivo transfer
      was 85 %. We hypothesize that this method could be applied to other endangered,
      slow growing taxa of Cactaceae thus contributing to the conservation of this
      endangered family.

TI  - Lactic Acid Fermentation of Cactus Cladodes (Opuntia ficus-indica L.) Generates
      Flavonoid Derivatives with Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Properties.
PG  - e0152575
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0152575 [doi]
AB  - Cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica L.) is widely distributed in the arid and
      semi-arid regions throughout the world. In the last decades, the interest towards
      vegetative crop increased, and cladodes are exploited for nutraceutical and
      health-promoting properties. This study aimed at investigating the capacity of
      selected lactic acid bacteria to increase the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
      properties of cactus cladodes pulp, with the perspective of producing a
      functional ingredient, dietary supplement or pharmaceutical preparation.
      Preliminarily, the antioxidant activity was determined through in vitro assays.
      Further, it was confirmed through ex vivo analysis on intestinal Caco-2/TC7
      cells, and the profile of flavonoids was characterized. Cactus cladode pulp was
      fermented with lactic acid bacteria, which were previously selected from plant
      materials. Chemically acidified suspension, without bacterial inoculum and
      incubated under the same conditions, was used as the control. Lactobacillus
      plantarum CIL6, POM1 and 1MR20, Lactobacillus brevis POM2 and POM4, Lactobacillus
      rossiae 2LC8 and Pediococcus pentosaceus CILSWE5 were the best growing strains.
      Fermentation of cladode pulp with L. brevis POM2 and POM4 allowed the highest
      concentration of gamma-amino butyric acid. Lactic acid fermentation had
      preservative effects (P<0.05) on the levels of vitamin C and carotenoids. Two
      flavonoid derivatives (kaemferol and isorhamnetin) were identified in the ethyl
      acetate extracts, which were considered to be the major compounds responsible for
      the increased radical scavenging activity. After inducing oxidative stress by
      IL-1beta, the increased antioxidant activity (P<0.05) of fermented cladode pulp
      was confirmed using Caco-2/TC7 cells. Fermented cladode pulp had also
      immune-modulatory effects towards Caco-2 cells. Compared to the control,
      fermented cladode pulp exhibited a significantly (P<0.05) higher inhibition of
      IL-8, TNFalpha and prostaglandins PGE2 synthesis. The highest functional effect
      was found using ethyl acetate extracts. In conclusion, fermentation, especially
      with L. plantarum strains and L. brevis POM4, enhanced the antioxidant and
      immune-modulation features of cladode pulp.

      natural treatment of second-degree burns till now. Therefore, the purpose of this
      study was to assess the wound-healing efficiency of three extracted oils, from
      the prickly pear, pumpkin and linseed on partial-thickness burns induced by
      fractional CO2 laser (an innovative up-to-date technique) in rats. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Thirty rats completing partial-thickness burns by fractional CO2 laser
      were randomly divided into five groups. The burns were measured, photographed,
      and topically treated daily with saline solution, "CYTOL BASIC," pumpkin-,
      linseed-, and prickly pear-extracted oils (0.52 muL/mm(2) of oil) until day 7.
      The response to treatments was assessed by macroscopic, histologic, and
      biochemical parameters. RESULTS: Due to their chemical composition, the extracted
      oils showed significant improvements over the control and reference groups during
      the trial for both general wound appearance and crusting. On day 7, the prickly
      pear, linseed, and pumpkin oils showed a significant decrease in the healing time
      (0 cm(2), 0.15 cm(2), and 0.18 cm(2), respectively) when compared to the control 
      and reference groups (1.49 cm(2) and 0.85 cm(2)). Histologic assessment of the
      prickly pear oil-treated group revealed good healing proprieties compared with
      the other groups. The collagen content in prickly pear oil-treated group was
      found to be significantly greater (270.67 +/- 7.48) than that in all other
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiment has shown, for the first time, a scientific
      evidence of the efficiency of extracted oils of prickly pear, pumpkin, and
      linseed on partial-thickness burns.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The fruits of Opuntia elatior Mill. are known as prickly pear and
      folkloric use as hematinic, anti-inflammatory and antiasthmatic action.
      Previously, the fruit juice of prickly pear was evaluated in reversed anemia
      induced by HgCl2 in a dose dependant manner and present study revealed about its 
      effect in acute hemolytic anemia. AIM: To evaluate the hematinic activity of
      fruits of Opuntia elatior Mill. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hematinic activity of 
      an orally administered fruit juice was studied on phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced
      anemic rats. The hematological parameters such as hemoglobin (Hb) content, red
      blood cell (RBC), packed cell volume (PCV), and reticulocyte count were analyzed 
      as indices of anemia. RESULTS: PHZ altered the hematological parameters by
      hemolysis characterized by a decrease in Hb content, total RBC counts and PCV (P 
      < 0.001) on day 3. The Hb content (g%) was significantly increased (P < 0.05) at 
      day 7 in 10 and 15 ml/kg fruit juice treated rats, which was a good improvement
      compared to the standard. CONCLUSION: The speedy and progressive recovery of
      anemic rats responding to treatment of the O. elatior Mill. fruits may be due to 
      increased erythropoiesis and/or antioxidant property of betacyanin.

TI  - Opuntia ficus-indica seed attenuates hepatic steatosis and promotes M2 macrophage
      polarization in high-fat diet-fed mice.

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) is a popular edible plant that possesses considerable
      nutritional value and exhibits diverse biological actions including
      anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic activities. In this study, we hypothesized
      that DWJ504, an extract of O ficus-indica seed, would ameliorate hepatic
      steatosis and inflammation by regulating hepatic de novo lipogenesis and
      macrophage polarization against experimental nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Mice
      were fed a normal diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. DWJ504 (250, 500,
      and 1000 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose) were orally
      administered for the last 4 weeks of the 10-week HFD feeding period. DWJ504
      treatment remarkably attenuated HFD-induced increases in hepatic lipid content
      and hepatocellular damage. DWJ504 attenuated increases in sterol regulatory
      element-binding protein 1 and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein
      expression and a decrease in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A. Although DWJ504
      augmented peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha protein expression, it
      attenuated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma expression. Moreover,
      DWJ504 promoted hepatic M2 macrophage polarization as indicated by attenuation of
      the M1 marker genes and enhancement of M2 marker genes. Finally, DWJ504
      attenuated expression of toll-like receptor 4, nuclear factor kappaB, tumor
      necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing
      interferon beta, and interferon beta levels. Our results demonstrate that DWJ504 
      prevented intrahepatic lipid accumulation, induced M2 macrophage polarization,
      and suppressed the toll-like receptor 4-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway. 
      Thus, DWJ504 has therapeutic potential in the prevention of nonalcoholic fatty
      liver disease.

TI  - Evaluation of the Biological Activity of Opuntia ficus indica as a Tissue- and
      Estrogen Receptor Subtype-Selective Modulator.
PG  - 971-80
LID - 10.1002/ptr.5602 [doi]
AB  - Phytoestrogens are selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) with potential 
      for use in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to relieve peri/postmenopausal
      symptoms. This study was aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying
      the SERM properties of the extract of Korean-grown Opuntia ficus-indica (KOFI).
      The KOFI extract induced estrogen response element (ERE)-driven transcription in 
      breast and endometrial cancer cell lines and the expression of endogenous
      estrogen-responsive genes in breast cancer cells. The flavonoid content of
      different KOFI preparations affected ERE-luciferase activities, implying that the
      flavonoid composition likely mediated the estrogenic activities in cells. Oral
      administration of KOFI decreased the weight gain and levels of both serum glucose
      and triglyceride in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Finally, KOFI had an inhibitory
      effect on the 17beta-estradiol-induced proliferation of the endometrial
      epithelium in OVX rats. Our data demonstrate that KOFI exhibited SERM activity
      with no uterotrophic side effects. Therefore, KOFI alone or in combination with
      other botanical supplements, vitamins, or minerals may be an effective and safe
      alternative active ingredient to HRTs, for the management of postmenopausal
      symptoms. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Plant-based culture media: Efficiently support culturing rhizobacteria and
      correctly mirror their in-situ diversity.
PG  - 305-16
LID - 10.1016/j.jare.2015.07.005 [doi]
AB  - Our previous publications and the data presented here provide evidences on the
      ability of plant-based culture media to optimize the cultivability of
      rhizobacteria and to support their recovery from plant-soil environments.
      Compared to the tested chemically-synthetic culture media (e.g. nutrient agar and
      N-deficient combined-carbon sources media), slurry homogenates, crude saps,
      juices and powders of cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) and succulent plants (Aloe
      vera and Aloe arborescens) were rich enough to support growth of rhizobacteria.
      Representative isolates of Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Bacillus spp. and 
      Azospirillum spp. exhibited good growth on agar plates of such plant-based
      culture media. Cell growth and biomass production in liquid batch cultures were
      comparable to those reported with the synthetic culture media. In addition, the
      tested plant-based culture media efficiently recovered populations of
      rhizobacteria associated to plant roots. Culturable populations of >10(6)-10(8)
      cfu g(-1) were recovered from the ecto- and endo-rhizospheres of tested host
      plants. More than 100 endophytic culture-dependent isolates were secured and
      subjected to morphophysiological identification. Factor and cluster analyses
      indicated the unique community structure, on species, genera, class and phyla
      levels, of the culturable population recovered with plant-based culture media,
      being distinct from that obtained with the chemically-synthetic culture media.
      Proteobacteria were the dominant (78.8%) on plant-based agar culture medium
      compared to only 31% on nutrient agar, while Firmicutes prevailed on nutrient
      agar (69%) compared to the plant-based agar culture media (18.2%). Bacteroidetes,
      represented by Chryseobacterium indologenes, was only reported (3%) among the
      culturable rhizobacteria community of the plant-based agar culture medium.

TI  - Presence of Multidrug-Resistant Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli,
      Enteropathogenic E. coli and Enterotoxigenic E. coli, on Raw Nopalitos (Opuntia
      ficus-indica L.) and in Nopalitos Salads from Local Retail Markets in Mexico.

AB  - The presence of multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria in food is a significant 
      public health concern. Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli pathotypes (DEPs) are
      foodborne bacteria. In Mexico, DEPs have been associated with diarrheal illness. 
      There is no information about the presence of multidrug-resistant DEPs on fresh
      vegetables and in cooked vegetable salads in Mexico. "Nopalitos" (Opuntia
      ficus-indica L.) is a Cactacea extensively used as a fresh green vegetable
      throughout Mexico. The presence of generic E. coli and multidrug-resistant DEPs
      on raw whole and cut nopalitos and in nopalitos salad samples was determined. One
      hundred raw whole nopalitos (without prickles) samples, 100 raw nopalitos cut
      into small square samples, and 100 cooked nopalitos salad samples were collected 
      from markets. Generic E. coli was determined using the most probable number
      procedures. DEPs were identified using two multiplex polymerase chain reaction
      procedures. Susceptibility to 16 antibiotics was tested for the isolated DEP
      strains by standard test. Of the 100 whole nopalitos samples, 100 cut nopalitos
      samples, and 100 nopalitos salad samples, generic E. coli and DEPs were
      identified, respectively, in 80% and 10%, 74% and 10%, and 64% and 8%. Eighty-two
      DEP strains were isolated from positive nopalitos samples. The identified DEPs
      included Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC),
      and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). All isolated strains exhibited resistance to 
      at least six antibiotics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report 
      of the presence of multidrug-resistant and antibiotic resistance profiles of
      STEC, ETEC, and EPEC on raw nopalitos and in nopalitos salads in Mexico.

TI  - Energetic costs and implications of the intake of plant secondary metabolites on 
      digestive and renal morphology in two austral passerines.
PG  - 625-37
LID - 10.1007/s00360-016-0974-4 [doi]
AB  - Seed-eating birds have a diet of high nutritional value; however, they must cope 
      with plant secondary metabolites (PSM). We postulated that the detoxification
      capacity of birds is associated with a metabolic cost, given that the organs
      responsible for detoxification significantly contribute to energetic metabolism. 
      We used an experimental approach to assess the effects of phenol-enriched diets
      on two passerines with different feeding habits: the omnivorous rufous-collared
      sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis) and the granivorous common diuca-finch (Diuca
      diuca). The birds were fed with one of three diets: control diet, supplemented
      with tannic acid, or supplemented with Opuntia ficus-indica phenolic extract (a
      common food of the sparrow but not the finch). After 5 weeks of exposure to the
      diets, we measured basal metabolic rates (BMR), energy intake, glucuronic acid
      output and digestive and kidney structure. In both species, detoxification
      capacity expressed as glucuronic acid output was higher in individuals consuming 
      phenol-enriched diets compared to the control diet. However, whereas sparrows
      increase energy intake and intestinal mass when feeding on phenol-enriched diets,
      finches had lower intestinal mass and energy intake remains stable. Furthermore, 
      sparrows had higher BMR on phenol-enriched diets compared to the control group,
      whereas in the finches BMR remains unchanged. Interspecific differences in
      response to phenols intake may be determined by the dietary habits of these
      species. While both species can feed on moderate phenolic diets for 5 weeks,
      energy costs may differ due to different responses in food intake and organ
      structure to counteract the effects of PSM intake.

TI  - Complex processing of prickly pear cactus (Opuntia sp.) by free-ranging
      long-tailed macaques: preliminary analysis for hierarchical organisation.
PG  - 141-7
LID - 10.1007/s10329-016-0525-3 [doi]
AB  - Complex food-processing techniques by gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans have 
      allowed comparisons of complex hierarchical cognition between great apes and
      humans. Here, we analyse preliminary observations of free-ranging long-tailed
      macaques (Macaca fascicularis) (n = 3) in Thailand processing Opuntia sp. cactus 
      fruits. From our observations, we suggest that there is potential to extend the
      analyses of hierarchical cognition to Old World monkeys. We found that the
      macaques used six behavioural sequences to obtain Opuntia fruits, remove irritant
      hairs from the skin of the fruits, and break open, and consume the fruits, each a
      unique combination of 17 action elements. Removing irritant hairs involved
      abrading fruits on a sand or rock substrate, and washing fruit in water. The
      behavioural sequences that macaques use to process Opuntia potentially show
      features of hierarchical organisation described in the leaf-processing behaviours
      of great apes. Our observations highlight the need for closer study of complex
      food-processing behaviour in monkeys to better understand the organisational
      capacities involved.

AB  - Betalain encapsulation was performed by ionic gelation as a stabilization
      strategy for these natural pigments. Betalains were extracted from purple cactus 
      fruits and encapsulated in calcium-alginate and in combination of calcium
      alginate and bovine serum albumin. Beads were characterised by scanning electron 
      microscopy and thermal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry and
      thermogravimetry. Moisture sorption isotherms were determined. Bead morphology
      was affected by matrix composition. Pigments storage stability was evaluated at
      different equilibrium relative humidity and temperatures. Pigment composition of 
      beads was determined by HPLC-MS-MS and degradation products were also analysed
      after storage; betalamic acid being the major one. Both types of matrices
      protected the encapsulated pigments, being their storage stability better at low 
      relative humidity than that of the non-encapsulated control material. Antiradical
      activities of beads were proportional to remaining betalain contents. At high
      relative humidity, there was no protection and low storage stability was observed
      in the samples.

TI  - The Cacti Microbiome: Interplay between Habitat-Filtering and Host-Specificity.
PG  - 150
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2016.00150 [doi]
AB  - Cactaceae represents one of the most species-rich families of succulent plants
      native to arid and semi-arid ecosystems, yet the associations Cacti establish
      with microorganisms and the rules governing microbial community assembly remain
      poorly understood. We analyzed the composition, diversity, and factors
      influencing above- and below-ground bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities
      associated with two native and sympatric Cacti species: Myrtillocactus
      geometrizans and Opuntia robusta. Phylogenetic profiling showed that the
      composition and assembly of microbial communities associated with Cacti were
      primarily influenced by the plant compartment; plant species, site, and season
      played only a minor role. Remarkably, bacterial, and archaeal diversity was
      higher in the phyllosphere than in the rhizosphere of Cacti, while the opposite
      was true for fungi. Semi-arid soils exhibited the highest levels of microbial
      diversity whereas the stem endosphere the lowest. Despite their taxonomic
      distance, M. geometrizans and O. robusta shared most microbial taxa in all
      analyzed compartments. Influence of the plant host did only play a larger role in
      the fungal communities of the stem endosphere. These results suggest that fungi
      establish specific interactions with their host plant inside the stem, whereas
      microbial communities in the other plant compartments may play similar functional
      roles in these two species. Biochemical and molecular characterization of
      seed-borne bacteria of Cacti supports the idea that these microbial symbionts may
      be vertically inherited and could promote plant growth and drought tolerance for 
      the fitness of the Cacti holobiont. We envision this knowledge will help improve 
      and sustain agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions of the world.

TI  - Opuntia dillenii cladode: Opuntiol and opuntioside attenuated cytokines and
      eicosanoids mediated inflammation.

AB  - ETHANOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Opuntia dillenii Haw (Nagphana) traditionally
      used against inflammation. The present study addressed the anti-inflammatory
      activity of O. dillenii derived methanol extract, fractions and pure compounds
      and their underlying mechanism of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: O. dillenii
      cladode methanol extract was subjected to vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC)
      furnishing two main fractions viz (T-1 and -2) leading to isolation of opuntiol
      (aglycone) and opuntioside (O-glucoside), respectively. Anti-inflammatory
      activity of extract, fractions, pure compounds and reference drugs were evaluated
      using: (1) arachidonic acid (AA) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate
      (TPA)-induced ear edema accompanied by histological studies of mice ear sections 
      and phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-induced mice paw edema. (2) Carrageenan and
      glycogen-induced peritonitis in rodents. In parallel levels of leukotriene B4
      (LTB4) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also determined via HPLC and
      fluoroemetrically using 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA)
      dye, respectively. Additionally, levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukins IL-1beta and -6 were measured by ELISA 
      assay. RESULTS: O. dillenii methanol extract, fractions and pure compounds
      reduced AA and TPA-induced ear punch weight in a dose dependent fashion. The
      corresponding IC50 values obtained also suppressed inflammatory features observed
      histologically. Furthermore, paw edema and peritonitis were also attenuated.
      Similar to indomethacin and diclofenac sodium, opuntioside reduced PGE2 levels of
      inflamed ear which was comparatively 1.3x better than opuntiol. However, opuntiol
      was more potent in reducing LTB4 levels in rat neutrophils with an IC50 value of 
      19+/-3.3muMu, while opuntioside was ineffective. Opuntiol also effectively
      suppressed ROS (37%) and cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and -6) by ~50% and
      comparable to dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: O. dillenii cladodes possess
      anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolites and
      cytokines. Opuntiol (aglycone) emerged as a dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase
      (COX) and lipooxygenase (LOX) pathways. It also suppressed ROS and cytokine
      levels. However, opuntioside manifested its selectivity towards COX (PGE2)
      pathway without affecting LTB4 levels. The present report describing the
      anti-inflammatory activity of opuntiol and opuntioside for the first time
      thereby, supporting and justifying the traditional use of O. dillenii against
      inflammation and may serve as lead compound in designing of new anti-inflammatory
      agents.

TI  - Bioactivity, proximate, mineral and volatile profiles along the flowering stages 
      of Opuntia microdasys (Lehm.): defining potential applications.
PG  - 1458-67
LID - 10.1039/c5fo01536g [doi]
AB  - Opuntia spp. flowers have been traditionally used for medical purposes, mostly
      because of their diversity in bioactive molecules with health promoting
      properties. The proximate, mineral and volatile compound profiles, together with 
      the cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties were characterized in O. microdasys
      flowers at different maturity stages, revealing several statistically significant
      differences. O. microdasys stood out mainly for its high contents of dietary
      fiber, potassium and camphor, and its high activities against HCT15 cells,
      Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus versicolor and Penicillium funiculosum. The
      vegetative stage showed the highest cytotoxic and antifungal activities, whilst
      the full flowering stage was particularly active against bacterial species. The
      complete dataset has been classified by principal component analysis, achieving
      clearly identifiable groups for each flowering stage, elucidating also the most
      distinctive features, and comprehensively profiling each of the assayed stages.
      The results might be useful to define the best flowering stage considering
      practical application purposes.

TI  - Betalains, Phenols and Antioxidant Capacity in Cactus Pear [Opuntia ficus-indica 
      (L.) Mill.] Fruits from Apulia (South Italy) Genotypes.
PG  - 269-80
LID - 10.3390/antiox4020269 [doi]
AB  - Betacyanin (betanin), total phenolics, vitamin C and antioxidant capacity (by
      Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and oxygen radical absorbance
      capacity (ORAC) assays) were investigated in two differently colored cactus pear 
      (Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill.) genotypes, one with purple fruit and the other 
      with orange fruit, from the Salento area, in Apulia (South Italy). In order to
      quantitate betanin in cactus pear fruit extracts (which is difficult by HPLC
      because of the presence of two isomers, betanin and isobetanin, and the lack of
      commercial standard with high purity), betanin was purified from Amaranthus
      retroflexus inflorescence, characterized by the presence of a single isomer. The 
      purple cactus pear variety showed very high betanin content, with higher levels
      of phenolics, vitamin C, and antioxidant capacity (TEAC) than the orange variety.
      These findings confirm the potential for exploiting the autochthonous
      biodiversity of cactus pear fruits. In particular, the purple variety could be an
      interesting source of colored bioactive compounds which not only have coloring
      potential, but are also an excellent source of dietary antioxidant components
      which may have beneficial effects on consumers' health.

      Biosorbent.
PG  - 832571
LID - 10.1155/2015/832571 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this research was to investigate the use of a natural adsorbent like
      nopal (Opuntia albicarpa L. Scheinvar) for removing cadmium from aqueous
      solutions with low concentrations of this metal. Two treatments were applied to
      the cladodes: a dehydration to get dehydrated nopal (DHN) and heating up to 90
      degrees C to obtain a thermally treated nopal (TN). After examining the effect of
      various pH values (2-7), the capacity of each biosorbent was examined in batch
      sorption tests at different dosages (0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 mg
      L(-1)). The results indicated that adsorption of cadmium to biomass of DHN and TN
      was highly dependent on pH and biosorbent dosage. The best removal of cadmium
      (53.3%, corresponding to q e of 0.155 mg g(-1)) was obtained at pH 4.0 by using
      the TN sorbent. Infrared and Raman spectra confirmed that cadmium removal
      occurred via adsorption to -OH functional groups.

TI  - [Importance of accurate assessment of capillary blood glucose level in diagnosis:
      misleading results in handlers of prickly pears (Opuntia ficus-indica)].
PG  - 247-248
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypoglycemia can cause symptoms of neuroglycopenia that can be easily
      confused with symptoms of greater clinical importance such as stroke. Appropriate
      differential diagnosis between these 2 processes will be essential for guiding
      the treatment approach. We report a case in which stroke was initially suspected 
      because hypoglycemia was masked by the incorrect capillary blood glucose (CBG)
      measurement technique used in treating an itinerant vendor of prickly pears
      (Opuntia ficus-indica). We studied the effects of prickly pear handling on the
      CBG levels in 11 vendors before and after they handled the fruit. CBG levels were
      noticeably higher after the fruit was handled in all cases. Our observations
      reveal the need to measure both capillary and venous blood glucose levels to rule
      out hypoglycemia in patients with acute neurological symptoms.

      atherogenesis in apoE knock-out mice.

AB  - Dietary intake of Opuntia species may prevent the development of cardiovascular
      diseases. The present study was designed to characterize the biological
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Opuntia species and to
      investigate whether Opuntia cladodes prevent the development of atherosclerosis
      in vivo, in apoE(-)KO mice. The effects of the two Opuntia species, the wild
      Opuntia streptacantha and the domesticated Opuntia ficus-indica, were tested on
      the generation of intra- and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      production and kinetics of the LDL oxidation by murine CRL2181 endothelial cells 
      and on the subsequent inflammatory signaling leading to the adhesion of monocytes
      on the activated endothelium and the formation of foam cells. Opuntia species
      blocked the extracellular ROS (superoxide anion) generation and LDL oxidation by 
      CRL2181, as well as the intracellular ROS rise and signaling evoked by the
      oxidized LDL, including the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor
      NFkappaB, the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 adhesion molecules, and the
      adhesion of monocytes to CRL2181. In vivo, Opuntia significantly reduced the
      formation of atherosclerotic lesions and the accumulation of 4-hydroxynonenal
      adducts in the vascular wall of apoE-KO mice, indicating that Opuntia cladodes
      prevent lipid oxidation in the vascular wall. In conclusion, wild and
      domesticated Opuntia species exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and
      antiatherogenic properties which emphasize their nutritional benefit for
      preventing cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - In this study, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of polysaccharides from
      Opuntia ficus indica Cladodes were investigated using response surface
      methodology (RSM). The effects of three extraction factors on the yield of
      mucilage were examined. The results indicated that the optimum extraction
      conditions were determined as follows: microwave power X1, 700 W; extraction time
      X2, 5.15 minand ratio water/raw material X3, 4.83 mL/g at fixed pH 11. Under
      these optimal extraction conditions, mucilage yield was found to be Y, 25.6%. A
      comparison between the model results and experimental data gave a high
      correlation coefficient (R(2)=0.88), adjusted coefficient (Radj=0.83) and low
      root mean square error (RMSE=2.45) and showed that the two models were able to
      predict a mucilage yield by green extraction microwave process.

AB  - We describe a sensitive plant monitoring system by the detection of the
      bioelectric potentials in plants with boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes. For
      sensor electrodes, we used commercially available BDD, Ag, and Pt plate
      electrodes. We tested this approach on a hybrid species in the genus Opuntia
      (potted) and three different trees (ground-planted) at different places in Japan.
      For the Opuntia, we artificially induced bioelectric potential changes by the
      surface potential using the fingers. We detected substantial changes in
      bioelectric potentials through all electrodes during finger touches on the
      surface of potted Opuntia hybrid plants, although the BDD electrodes were several
      times more sensitive to bioelectric potential change compared to the other
      electrodes. Similarly for ground-planted trees, we found that both BDD and Pt
      electrodes detected bioelectric potential change induced by changing
      environmental factors (temperature and humidity) for months without
      replacing/removing/changing electrodes, BDD electrodes were 5-10 times more
      sensitive in this detection than Pt electrodes. Given these results, we conclude 
      that BDD electrodes on live plant tissue were able to consistently detect
      bioelectrical potential changes in plants.

AB  - Total Pectins Fraction (TPF) was extracted at room temperature from dried
      cladodes of Opuntia ficus indica. TPF is constituted of three pectic fractions
      WSP, CSP and ASP, which are made up of 66.6%, 44.3% and 81.1% (w/w) of
      galacturonic acid, respectively. The antioxidant ability of TPF increased with
      the concentration increasing. It scavenged hydroxyl radical by 90% and chelated
      90% of ferrous ions at 5 g/L. FTIR study was carried out. Strong characteristic
      absorption peaks at 1,618 cm(-1) assigned to the vibration of COO(-) group of
      galacturonic acid. In the fingerprint region, we noticed three well-defined peaks
      at 1054, 1085, and 1,154 cm(-1) characteristic of pectic polysaccharides. TPF are
      non-gelling pectins. The co-crosslinking of TPF with carrageenan was carried out 
      and the gelling behavior was successfully improved. Thermo-sensitive hydrogel was
      obtained with 82% of TPF and 18% of carrageenan (w/w).

AB  - Heavy metal ion, pesticide and dye wastewaters cause severe ecological
      contamination with conventional treatment methods proving inadequate,
      unsuccessful or expensive to apply. Several biomaterials have recently been
      explored for the biosorption and biocoagulation-flocculation of pollutants from
      wastewaters. In the past 10 years, there has been an extensive research output on
      the use of biological materials such as agricultural wastes, chitosan, Moringa
      Oleifera, Eichhornia crassipes, bacteria, algae, Cactus plants etc. in
      environmental remediation. The present paper reviews the scattered information
      about the green technology involving Opuntia ficus-indica derived biomaterials in
      wastewater decontamination. Its characterization, physicochemical compositions,
      its application in biosorption and flocculation of dyes, pesticides and metallic 
      species focussing on equilibrium, kinetics and thermodynamic properties are
      reviewed. The main results obtained in the depollution of a variety of
      contaminated wastewaters using cladodes, fruit pulp and peels mucilage and
      electrolytes show very high and promising pollutant maximum sorption capacities
      and removal percentages in the range -125.4-1000 mg/g and 0.31-2251.56 mg/g for
      the biosorption of dyes and metallic species respectively and removal % ranges of
      50-98.7%, 11-93.62% and 17-100% for turbidity, chemical oxygen demand and heavy
      metals respectively by coagulation-flocculation process. The biomaterials proved 
      to be efficient in pollutant removal that there is need to explore the scaling up
      of the study from the laboratory scale to community pilot plants and eventually
      to industrial levels.

AB  - The stems of Opuntia ficus-indica known as cladodes are rich source of bioactive 
      and functional substances, which make them important candidate for the production
      of health-promoting food. Cladodes powder was incorporated at different levels of
      substitution (2.5%, 5% and 7.5%) in cookies (butter/wheat flour: 55/100 m/m).
      Substitution of wheat flour by cladodes powder improved dietary fiber, ash,
      potassium, magnesium and calcium contents of enriched cookies. The results also
      revealed that cladodes supplementation increased hardness; however, it decreased 
      a* and b* values and reduced exudate loss of cookies during storage. Moreover,
      rising levels of cladodes powder contribute to the increase of antioxidant
      activity of cookies and decreased their oxidative degradation. Sensory evaluation
      showed that cladodes supplementation at 5% level remained acceptable at 5-point
      hedonic scale. The present study suggested that cladodes supplementation in
      high-fat cookies not only added nutritional value to food, but also improved its 
      functional characteristics.

TI  - Agave as a model CAM crop system for a warming and drying world.
PG  - 684
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2015.00684 [doi]
AB  - As climate change leads to drier and warmer conditions in semi-arid regions,
      growing resource-intensive C3 and C4 crops will become more challenging. Such
      crops will be subjected to increased frequency and intensity of drought and heat 
      stress. However, agaves, even more than pineapple (Ananas comosus) and prickly
      pear (Opuntia ficus-indica and related species), typify highly productive plants 
      that will respond favorably to global warming, both in natural and cultivated
      settings. With nearly 200 species spread throughout the U.S., Mexico, and Central
      America, agaves have evolved traits, including crassulacean acid metabolism
      (CAM), that allow them to survive extreme heat and drought. Agaves have been used
      as sources of food, beverage, and fiber by societies for hundreds of years. The
      varied uses of Agave, combined with its unique adaptations to environmental
      stress, warrant its consideration as a model CAM crop. Besides the damaging
      cycles of surplus and shortage that have long beset the tequila industry, the
      relatively long maturation cycle of Agave, its monocarpic flowering habit, and
      unique morphology comprise the biggest barriers to its widespread use as a crop
      suitable for mechanized production. Despite these challenges, agaves exhibit
      potential as crops since they can be grown on marginal lands, but with more
      resource input than is widely assumed. If these constraints can be reconciled,
      Agave shows considerable promise as an alternative source for food, alternative
      sweeteners, and even bioenergy. And despite the many unknowns regarding agaves,
      they provide a means to resolve disparities in resource availability and needs
      between natural and human systems in semi-arid regions.

LID - 10.3109/09637486.2015.1088938 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study is to compare three cultivars of prickly pear fruits
      ("Sanguigna" red, "Sulfarina" yellow and "Muscaredda" white) regarding the
      quality parameters of antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds, betalains and
      ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Depending on the crop operation, these cultivars are
      represented by "Agostane" and "Bastardoni" and are located at an altitude between
      150 and 750 m, above sea level. Their antioxidant activity was evaluated by ORAC 
      assay. Total phenolic compounds, betalains and ascorbic acid recovered from pulp 
      juice, were determined by a spectrophotometric analysis. The results indicate
      that the different cultivars of prickly pear possess antioxidant activity in
      function of the type of the adopted practice. These fruits were derived from the 
      practice of scozzolatura, by dropping the berries to encourage a second bloom of 
      the plant. Among the "Bastardoni", the "Sulfarina" possesses the highest
      antioxidant activity.

TI  - Transcriptional variation associated with cactus host plant adaptation in
      Drosophila mettleri populations.
PG  - 5186-99
LID - 10.1111/mec.13388 [doi]
AB  - Although the importance of host plant chemistry in plant-insect interactions is
      widely accepted, the genetic basis of adaptation to host plants is not well
      understood. Here, we investigate transcriptional changes associated with a host
      plant shift in Drosophila mettleri. While D. mettleri is distributed mainly
      throughout the Sonoran Desert where it specializes on columnar cacti (Carnegiea
      gigantea and Pachycereus pringleii), a population on Santa Catalina Island has
      shifted to chemically divergent coastal prickly pear cactus (Opuntia littoralis).
      We compared gene expression of larvae from the Sonoran Desert and Santa Catalina 
      Island when reared on saguaro (C. gigantea), coastal prickly pear and laboratory 
      food. Consistent with expectations based on the complexity and toxicity of cactus
      relative to laboratory food, within-population comparisons between larvae reared 
      on these food sources revealed transcriptional differences in detoxification and 
      other metabolic pathways. The majority of transcriptional differences between
      populations on the cactus hosts were independent of the rearing environment and
      included a disproportionate number of genes involved in processes relevant to
      host plant adaptation (e.g. detoxification, central metabolism and chemosensory
      pathways). Comparisons of transcriptional reaction norms between the two
      populations revealed extensive shared plasticity that likely allowed colonization
      of coastal prickly pear on Santa Catalina Island. We also found that while
      plasticity may have facilitated subsequent adaptive divergence in gene expression
      between populations, the majority of genes that differed in expression on the
      novel host were not transcriptionally plastic in the presumed ancestral state.

      Controlled Study.
PG  - 343-52
LID - 10.1177/1534734615598064 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this article is to investigate the effect of Opuntia stricta H
      (Cactaceae) extract on suppression of hypertrophic scar on ventral surface wounds
      of rabbit ears. Full thickness skin defection was established in a rabbit ear to 
      simulate hypertrophic scar. Opuntia extract was sprayed on the wounds in the
      experimental group, and normal saline was used in the control group. After the
      wounds healed with scar formation, the hypertrophic scar tissue was harvested on 
      days 22, 39, and 54 for histological analysis. The expression of type I and type 
      III collagen and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) were evaluated by
      immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The
      results indicated that the scar of the control group is more prominent compared
      with the opuntia extract group. The expression of type I collagen in the opuntia 
      extract group was lower than the control group, while type III collagen in
      opuntia extract group gradually increased and exceeded control group. The
      expression of MMP-1 decreased in the opuntia extract group, while the control
      group increased over time, but the amount of MMP-1 was much higher than that in
      the control group on day 22. In conclusion, opuntia extract reduces hypertrophic 
      scar formation by means of type I collagen inhibition, and increasing type III
      collagen and MMP-1.T he novel application of opuntia extract may lead to
      innovative and effective antiscarring therapies.

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica flowers are used for various medicinal purposes. The aims of
      the present investigation were to evaluate biological properties of O.
      ficus-indica flowers extracts and to investigate its antioxidant and
      antibacterial activities and its ability to enhance wound healing. The wound
      healing activity of the mucilaginous and methanol extracts of O. ficus-indica
      flowers were assessed using excision wound model in rats. After thirteen days of 
      treatment by both extracts, a beneficial effect on cutaneous repair was observed 
      as assessed by the acceleration of wound contraction and remodeling phases.
      Histopathological studies of the granulation tissue indicated that the derma is
      properly arranged with the Opuntia flowers extract, compared with the control
      group. The mucilage extract was more effective than the methanol extract, but
      both showed significant results compared with the control. Such investigation was
      supported by the efficiency of the methanolic and mucilage extract as
      antimicrobial and antioxidant. Indeed, the extracts showed a potential
      antioxidant activity determined by different test systems, namely DPPH radicals
      scavenging activity, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, reducing power,
      beta-carotene bleaching assay and metal chelating activity and exhibited
      significant antibacterial activity against almost all tested bacteria.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro antioxidant power of cactus pear seed oil
      [Opuntia ficus-indica L. MILL. (CPSO)] and its protective effect against
      chemically induced diabetes mellitus in mice. METHODS: The in vitro antioxidant
      effect of CPSO was evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)
      scavenging assay. The preventive effect was conducted on Swiss albino mice
      treated with CPSO (2 mL/kg, per os), before and after a single intraperitoneal
      alloxan administration (100 mg/kg). Survival rate, body weight and fasting blood 
      glucose were measured and histopathological analysis of pancreas was performed to
      evaluate alloxan-induced tissue injuries. RESULTS: CPSO exhibited an antioxidant 
      effect in DPPH scavenging assay. Moreover, the administration of CPSO (2 mL/kg)
      significantly attenuated alloxan-induced death and hyperglycemia (P < 0.001) in
      treated mice. Morphometric study of pancreas revealed that CPSO significantly
      protected islets of langerhans against alloxan induced-tissue alterations.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on theses results, CPSO can prevente alloxan-induced-diabetes 
      by quenching free radicals produced by alloxan and inhibiting tissue injuries in 
      pancreatic beta-cells.

TI  - The physiological response of two green calcifying algae from the Great Barrier
      Reef towards high dissolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC and DOC)
      availability.
PG  - e0133596
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0133596 [doi]
AB  - Increasing dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations associated with ocean 
      acidification can affect marine calcifiers, but local factors, such as high
      dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations through sewage and algal blooms,
      may interact with this global factor. For calcifying green algae of the genus
      Halimeda, a key tropical carbonate producer that often occurs in coral reefs, no 
      studies on these interactions have been reported. These data are however urgently
      needed to understand future carbonate production. Thus, we investigated the
      independent and combined effects of DIC (pCO2 402 muatm/ pHtot 8.0 and 996 muatm/
      pHtot 7.7) and DOC (added as glucose in 0 and 294 mumol L-1) on growth,
      calcification and photosynthesis of H. macroloba and H. opuntia from the Great
      Barrier Reef in an incubation experiment over 16 days. High DIC concentrations
      significantly reduced dark calcification of H. opuntia by 130 % and led to net
      dissolution, but did not affect H. macroloba. High DOC concentrations
      significantly reduced daily oxygen production of H. opuntia and H. macroloba by
      78 % and 43 %, respectively, and significantly reduced dark calcification of H.
      opuntia by 70%. Combined high DIC and DOC did not show any interactive effects
      for both algae, but revealed additive effects for H. opuntia where the
      combination of both factors reduced dark calcification by 162 % compared to
      controls. Such species-specific differences in treatment responses indicate H.
      opuntia is more susceptible to a combination of high DIC and DOC than H.
      macroloba. From an ecological perspective, results further suggest a reduction of
      primary production for Halimeda-dominated benthic reef communities under high DOC
      concentrations and additional decreases of carbonate accretion under elevated DIC
      concentrations, where H. opuntia dominates the benthic community. This may reduce
      biogenic carbonate sedimentation rates and hence the buffering capacity against
      further ocean acidification.

AB  - Opuntia flowers are a natural source of biologically active compounds and they
      have been used as medicinal plant for a long time. Despite the various uses
      reported for the decoction and infusion of these flowers, their characterization 
      has been discarded. In this study, the decoction and infusion prepared from
      Opuntia ficus-indica were analyzed with respect to their content in minerals and 
      phytochemicals in order to evaluate its nutritional characteristics. The obtained
      data proved that these preparations are a rich source of minerals mainly K and
      Ca. Moreover, the phytochemical analysis revealed that they have important
      polyphenols, flavonoids and tannins contents with the infusion that presented the
      highest polyphenol levels. LC-MS analyses of decoction and infusion allowed the
      characterization of 20 phenolic compounds. It is mainly identified by the
      presence of flavonols glycosides.

TI  - Variation in the local population dynamics of the short-lived Opuntia macrorhiza 
      (Cactaceae).
PG  - 800-7
AB  - Spatiotemporal variation in demographic rates can have profound effects for
      population persistence, especially for dispersal-limited species living in
      fragmented landscapes. Long-term studies of plants in such habitats help with
      understanding the impacts of fragmentation on population persistence but such
      studies are rare. In this work, we reanalyzed demographic data from seven years
      of the short-lived cactus Opuntia macrorhiza var. macrorhiza at five plots in
      Boulder, Colorado. Previous work combining data from all years and all plots
      predicted a stable population (deterministic log lamda approximately 0). This
      approach assumed that all five plots were part of a single population. Since the 
      plots were located in a suburban-agricultural interface separated by highways,
      grazing lands, and other barriers, and O. macrorhiza is likely dispersal limited,
      we analyzed the dynamics of each plot separately using stochastic matrix models
      assuming each plot represented a separate population. We found that the
      stochastic population growth rate log lamdaS varied widely between populations
      (log lamdaS = 0.1497, 0.0774, -0.0230, -0.2576, -0.4989). The three populations
      with the highest growth rates were located close together in space, while the two
      most isolated populations had the lowest growth rates suggesting that dispersal
      between populations is critical for the population viability of O. macrorhiza.
      With one exception, both our prospective (stochastic elasticity) and
      retrospective (stochastic life table response experiments) analysis suggested
      that means of stasis and growth, especially of smaller plants, were most
      important for population growth rate. This is surprising because recruitment is
      typically the most important vital rate in a short-lived species such as O.
      macrorhiza. We found that elasticity to the variance was mostly negligible,
      suggesting that O. macrorhiza populations are buffered against large temporal
      variation. Finally, single-year elasticities to means of transitions to the
      smallest stage (mostly due to reproduction) and growth differed considerably from
      their long-term elasticities. It is important to be aware of this difference when
      using models to predict the effect of manipulating plant vital rates within the
      time frame of typical plant demographic studies.

TI  - Indicaxanthin from Opuntia ficus-indica Crosses the Blood-Brain Barrier and
      Modulates Neuronal Bioelectric Activity in Rat Hippocampus at Dietary-Consistent 
      Amounts.
PG  - 7353-60
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.5b02612 [doi]
AB  - Indicaxanthin is a bioactive and bioavailable betalain pigment from the Opuntia
      ficus-indica fruits. In this in vivo study, kinetic measurements showed that
      indicaxanthin is revealed in the rat brain within 1 h from oral administration of
      2 mumol/kg, an amount compatible with a dietary consumption of cactus pear fruits
      in humans. A peak (20 +/- 2.4 ng of indicaxanthin per whole brain) was measured
      after 2.5 h; thereafter the molecule disappeared with first order kinetics within
      4 h. The potential of indicaxanthin to affect neural activities was in vivo
      investigated by a microiontophoretic approach. Indicaxanthin, administered in a
      range between 0.085 ng and 0.34 ng per neuron, dose-dependently modulated the
      rate of discharge of spontaneously active neurons of the hippocampus, with
      reduction of the discharge and related changes of latency and duration of the
      effect. Indicaxanthin (0.34 ng/neuron) showed inhibitory effects on
      glutamate-induced excitation, indicating activity at the level of glutamatergic
      synapses. A molecular target of indicaxanthin is suggested by in silico molecular
      modeling of indicaxanthin with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), the most
      represented of the glutamate receptor family in hippocampus. Therefore, at
      nutritionally compatible amounts indicaxanthin (i) crosses the rat BBB and
      accumulates in brain; (ii) can affect the bioelectric activity of hippocampal
      neurons locally treated with amounts comparable with those measured in the brain;
      and (iii) modulates glutamate-induced neuronal excitation. The potential of
      dietary indicaxanthin as a natural neuromodulatory agent deserves further
      mechanistic and neurophysiologic investigation.

TI  - [Therapeutic effects and mechanisms of Opuntia dillenii Haw on atherosclerosis of
      rats].
PG  - 453-8
AB  - The research aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of
      Opuntia dillenii Haw polysaccharide (OPS) on atherosclerosis of rats. First
      atherosclerotic rat models were established by high-fat and high-calcium diet.
      Thirty days later, the rats were treated with low dosage of OPS (0.2 g x kg(-1) x
      d(-1)) or high dosage of OPS (0.4 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) by intraperitoneal
      injection for 60 days continuously. At the end of treatment, thoracic aorta rings
      were prepared and vasorelaxation of rat thoracic aorta in different experiment
      groups were determined by using 620M multi wire myograph system in vitro. Blood
      and livers of rats were collected. Then plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), 
      triglyceride (TG) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) of rats were separately
      determined using whole automatic biochemical analyzer; protein level of hepatic
      apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and that of hepatic diglyceride acyltransferase (Dgat1)
      were measured by Western Blot technique. Results showed that the ability of rat
      thoracic aorta to relax decreased markedly in the model group compared with that 
      in the normal group, and significant differences existed in vasorelaxation ratios
      induced by different concentrations of carbamylcholine chloride (Carb) between
      these two groups (P < 0.01). After OPS treatment, the ability of rat thoracic
      aorta to relax improved markedly, the vasorelaxation ratios induced by Carb at 5 
      and 10 mumol x L(-1) were respectively 0.34 +/- 0.08 and 0.62 +/- 0.15 in the
      group treated with low dosage of OPS, while the ratios induced by Carb at 1 and 5
      mumol x L(-1) were respectively 0.54 +/- 0.08 and 0.98 +/- 0.02 in the group
      treated with high dosage of OPS, which were all significantly different with
      those in the model group (P < 0.01). Plasma contents of TC, TG and LDL reduced
      significantly by the treatments both with low and high dosages of OPS compared
      with those in the model group (P < 0.01). Protein level of hepatic ApoB and that 
      of hepatic Dgat1 decreased significantly after the treatment with high dosage of 
      OPS compared with those in the model group (P < 0.01). These results indicate
      that OPS can markedly improve the vasorelaxation of thoracic aorta of
      atherosclerotic rats and has significant anti-atherosclerotic effect; inhibiting 
      the expression of ApoB and Dgat1 and thus decreasing the amounts of TC, LDL and
      TG serving as one of the molecular mechanisms of its antiatherosclerosis effect.

TI  - Antioxidant potential and its relationship with polyphenol content and degree of 
      polymerization in Opuntia elatior Mill. fruits.
PG  - 423-7
LID - 10.4103/0974-8520.159010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opuntia elatior Mill. (Nagaphani) fruits are traditionally
      recommended as an expectorant, remedy for whooping cough, asthma, gonorrhea,
      ulcers, tumors, in the treatment of diarrhea and syphilis. Many of these diseases
      are allied with oxidative stress caused by free radicals. Thus, current research 
      is directed towards finding naturally-occurring antioxidants of plant origin.
      AIM: To evaluate antioxidant potential of hydro-alcoholic extract of the O.
      elatior fruits (HAOE) and its fractions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using
      1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and nitric oxide radical scavenging assay,
      total polyphenolic, flavonoid (FA), flavanone (FO) contents and degree of
      polymerization in relation with its antioxidant activity were examined. RESULTS: 
      The experimental data indicated that the HAOE, ethyl acetate (EAOE) and butanol
      (BFOE) soluble fractions have shown significant antioxidant activity. The highest
      polyphenolic, FA, FO contents and degree of polymerization were found in EAOE.
      The scavenging potential was in the order of Ascorbic Acid > EAOE > BFOE > HAOE >
      BIOE, where ascorbic acid was used as a positive control. The increased
      antioxidant potential of EAOE and BFOE fractions over HAOE extract may be
      attributed to the purification achieved by fractionation of the extract which in 
      turn resulted in an increase in the degree of polymerization and segregation of
      secondary metabolites. CONCLUSION: The fruit of O. elatior can be used as the
      best alternative for synthetic antioxidants.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in color, betalain content,
      browning index, viscosity, physical stability, microbiological growth,
      antioxidant content and antioxidant activity of purple cactus pear juice during
      storage after thermoultrasonication at 80% amplitude level for 15 and 25 min in
      comparison with pasteurized juice. Thermoultrasound treatment for 25 min
      increased color stability and viscosity compared to treatment for 15 min (6.83
      and 6.72 MPa, respectively), but this last parameter was significantly lower
      (p<0.05) compared to the control and pasteurized juices (22.47 and 26.32 MPa,
      respectively). Experimental treatment reduced significantly (p<0.05) sediment
      solids in juices. Total plate counts decreased from the first day of storage
      exhibiting values of 1.38 and 1.43 logCFU/mL, for 15 and 25 min treatment,
      respectively. Compared to the control, both treatments reduced enterobacteria
      counts (1.54 logCFU/mL), and compared to pasteurized juice decreased
      pectinmethylesterase activity (3.76 and 3.82 UPE/mL), maintained high values of
      ascorbic acid (252.05 and 257.18 mg AA/L) and antioxidant activity (by ABTS:
      124.8 and 115.6 mg VCEAC/100 mL; and DPPH: 3114.2 and 2757.1 mumol TE/L). During 
      storage thermoultrasonicated juices had a minimum increase in
      pectinmethylesterase activity (from day 14), and exhibited similar total plate
      counts to pasteurized juice. An increase of phenolic content was observed after
      14 days of storage, particularly for treatment at 80%, 25 min, and an increase in
      antioxidant activity (ABTS, DPPH) by the end of storage.

TI  - Kaempferol suppresses lipid accumulation by inhibiting early adipogenesis in
      3T3-L1 cells and zebrafish.
PG  - 2824-33
LID - 10.1039/c5fo00481k [doi]
AB  - Kaempferol is a flavonoid present in Kaempferia galanga and Opuntia ficus indica 
      var. saboten. Recent studies have suggested that it has anti-oxidant,
      anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-obesity effects. In this study, we
      focused on the anti-adipogenic effects of kaempferol during adipocyte
      differentiation. The results showed that kaempferol inhibits lipid accumulation
      in adipocytes and zebrafish. Oil Red O and Nile Red staining showed that the
      number of intracellular lipid droplets decreased in adipocytes and zebrafish
      treated with kaempferol. LPAATtheta (lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase),
      lipin1, and DGAT1 (triglyceride synthetic enzymes) and FASN and SREBP-1C (fatty
      acid synthetic proteins) showed decreased expression levels in the presence of
      kaempferol. In addition, treatment of kaempferol showed an inhibitory activity on
      cell cycle progression. Kaempferol delayed cell cycle progression from the S to
      G2/M phase through the regulation of cyclins in a dose-dependent manner.
      Kaempferol blocked the phosphorylation of AKT (protein kinase B) and mammalian
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway during the early stages of
      adipogenesis. In addition, kaempferol down-regulated pro-early adipogenic factors
      such as CCAAT-enhancer binding proteins beta (C/EBPbeta), and Kruppel-like
      factors (KLFs) 4 and 5, while anti-early adipogenic factors, such as KLF2 and
      pref-1(preadipocyte factor-1), were upregulated. These kaempferol-mediated
      regulations of early adipogenic factors resulted in the attenuation of late
      adipogenic factors such as C/EBPalpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated
      receptor gamma (PPARgamma). These results were supported in zebrafish based on
      the decrease in lipid accumulation and expression of adipogenic factors. Our
      results indicated that kaempferol might have an anti-obesity effect by regulating
      lipid metabolism.

      prevents eryptosis induced by oxysterols in a hypercholesterolaemia-relevant
      proportion and adhesion of human erythrocytes to endothelial cell layers.
PG  - 368-75
LID - 10.1017/S0007114515002111 [doi]
AB  - Toxic oxysterols in a hypercholesterolaemia-relevant proportion cause suicidal
      death of human erythrocytes or eryptosis. This process proceeds through early
      production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), release of prostaglandin (PGE2) and 
      opening of PGE2-dependent Ca channels, membrane phosphatidylserine (PS)
      externalisation, and cell shrinkage. The present study was the first to reveal
      that a bioavailable phytochemical, indicaxanthin (Ind) from cactus pear fruit, in
      a concentration range (1.0-5.0 muM) consistent with its plasma level after a
      fruit meal, prevents PS externalisation and cell shrinkage in a dose-dependent
      manner when incubated with isolated healthy human erythrocytes exposed to an
      oxysterol mixture for 48 h. Dietary Ind inhibited ROS production, glutathione
      (GSH) depletion, PGE2 release and Ca2+ entry. Ind alone did not modify the
      erythrocyte redox environment or affect other parameters. Ex vivo spiking of
      normal human blood with the oxysterol mixture for 48 h induced eryptosis,
      resulting in the production of ROS and decreased levels of GSH, which was
      prevented by concurrent exposure to 5 mum-Ind. The adherence of eryptotic
      erythrocytes to the endothelium causes vascular tissue injury. Erythrocytes
      isolated from blood incubated with the oxysterol mixture plus 5 mum-Ind did not
      adhere to endothelial cell monolayers. Eryptotic erythrocytes may contribute to
      thrombotic complications in hypercholesterolaemia. Our findings suggest the
      positive effects of diets containing Ind on erythrocytes in hypercholesterolaemic
      subjects.

PG  - 75-81
LID - 10.4103/0975-9476.159025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opuntia elatio Mill is a xerophytic plant with potentially active
      nutrients. It is traditionally appreciated for its pharmacological properties;
      however, the scientific information on this plant is insufficient. OBJECTIVE: The
      present study evaluates the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory action of
      prickly pear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Writhing and tail-immersion tests were
      carried out to evaluate analgesic action, while the carrageenan-induced paw edema
      and neutrophil adhesion tests were conducted in Albino wistar rats to assess
      anti-inflammatory action. RESULTS: ED50 values of the fruit juice in writhing,
      tail immersion, and paw edema test were 0.919, 2.77, and 9.282 ml/kg,
      respectively. The fruits of Opuntia produced analgesic and anti-inflammatory
      action in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The results establish the folklore
      use of prickly pear may be due to the presence of betacyanin and/or other
      phenolic compounds.

TI  - Antimicrobial activities of endophytic fungi obtained from the arid zone invasive
      plant Opuntia dillenii and the isolation of equisetin, from endophytic Fusarium
      sp.
PG  - 220
LID - 10.1186/s12906-015-0722-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opuntia dillenii is an invasive plant well established in the harsh
      South-Eastern arid zone of Sri Lanka. Evidence suggests it is likely that the
      endophytic fungal populations of O. dillenii assist the host in overcoming biotic
      and abiotic stress by producing biologically active metabolites. With this in
      mind there is potential to discover novel natural products with useful biological
      activities from this hitherto poorly investigated source. Consequently, an
      investigation of the antimicrobial activities of the endophytes of O. dillenii,
      that occupies a unique ecological niche, may well provide useful leads in the
      discovery of new pharmaceuticals. METHODS: Endophytic fungi were isolated from
      the surface sterilized cladodes and flowers of O. dillenii using several nutrient
      media and the antimicrobial activities were evaluated against three Gram-positive
      and two Gram-negative bacteria and Candida albicans. The two most bioactive fungi
      were identified by colony morphology and DNA sequencing. The secondary metabolite
      of the endophyte Fusarium sp. exhibiting the best activity was isolated via
      bioassay guided chromatography. The chemical structure was elucidated from the
      ESIMS and NMR spectroscopic data obtained for the active metabolite. The minimum 
      inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the active compound were determined. RESULTS:
      Eight endophytic fungi were isolated from O. dillenii and all except one showed
      antibacterial activities against at least one of the test bacteria. All extracts 
      were inactive against C. albicans. The most bioactive fungus was identified as
      Fusarium sp. and the second most active as Aspergillus niger. The structure of
      the major antibacterial compound of the Fusarium sp. was shown to be the tetramic
      acid derivative, equisetin. The MIC's for equisetin were 8 mug mL(-1) against
      Bacillus subtilis, 16 mug mL(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus and Methicillin
      Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). CONCLUSIONS: O. dillenii, harbors several
      endophytic fungi capable of producing antimicrobial substances with selective
      antibacterial properties. By producing biologically active secondary metabolites,
      such as equisetin isolated from the endophytic Fusarium sp., the endophytic
      fungal population may be assisting the host to successfully withstand stressful
      environmental conditions. Further investigations on the secondary metabolites
      produced by these endophytes may provide additional drug leads.

TI  - Potential of Opuntia ficus-indica for air pollution biomonitoring: a lead
      isotopic study.
PG  - 17799-809
LID - 10.1007/s11356-015-4998-1 [doi]
AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica (Ofi) is a long-domesticated cactus that is widespread
      throughout arid and semiarid regions. Ofi is grown for both its fruits and edible
      cladodes, which are flattened photosynthetic stems. Young cladodes develop from
      mother cladodes, thus forming series of cladodes of different ages. Therefore,
      successive cladodes may hold some potential for biomonitoring over several years 
      the local atmospheric pollution. In this study, cladodes, roots, dust deposited
      onto the cladodes, and soil samples were collected in the vicinity of three
      heavily polluted sites, i.e., a fertilizer industry, the road side of a highway, 
      and mine tailings. The lead content was analyzed using atomic absorption
      spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
      Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
      (SEM-EDX) was used to characterize the cladode surfaces and the nature of dust
      deposit, and the lead isotopes were analyzed to identify the origin of Pb. The
      results show that (i) Ofi readily bioaccumulates Pb, (ii) the lead isotopic
      composition of cladodes evidences a foliar pathway of lead into Ofi and
      identifies the relative contributions of local Pb sources, and (iii) an evolution
      of air quality is recorded with successive cladodes, which makes Ofi a potential 
      biomonitor to be used in environmental and health studies.

TI  - A roadmap for research on crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) to enhance
      sustainable food and bioenergy production in a hotter, drier world.
PG  - 491-504
LID - 10.1111/nph.13393 [doi]
AB  - Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a specialized mode of photosynthesis that
      features nocturnal CO2 uptake, facilitates increased water-use efficiency (WUE), 
      and enables CAM plants to inhabit water-limited environments such as semi-arid
      deserts or seasonally dry forests. Human population growth and global climate
      change now present challenges for agricultural production systems to increase
      food, feed, forage, fiber, and fuel production. One approach to meet these
      challenges is to increase reliance on CAM crops, such as Agave and Opuntia, for
      biomass production on semi-arid, abandoned, marginal, or degraded agricultural
      lands. Major research efforts are now underway to assess the productivity of CAM 
      crop species and to harness the WUE of CAM by engineering this pathway into
      existing food, feed, and bioenergy crops. An improved understanding of CAM has
      potential for high returns on research investment. To exploit the potential of
      CAM crops and CAM bioengineering, it will be necessary to elucidate the
      evolution, genomic features, and regulatory mechanisms of CAM. Field trials and
      predictive models will be required to assess the productivity of CAM crops, while
      new synthetic biology approaches need to be developed for CAM engineering.
      Infrastructure will be needed for CAM model systems, field trials, mutant
      collections, and data management.

TI  - Comparative Thermal Degradation Patterns of Natural Yellow Colorants Used in
      Foods.
PG  - 380-7
LID - 10.1007/s11130-015-0499-0 [doi]
AB  - There is a great interest in natural yellow colorants due to warnings issued
      about certain yellow food colorings of synthetic origin. However, no comparative 
      studies have been reported of their thermal stability. For this reason, the
      thermal stabilities of six natural yellow colorants used in foods--lutein,
      riboflavin, curcumin, ss-carotene, gardenia yellow and Opuntia betaxanthins--were
      studied in simple solutions over a temperature range 30-90 degrees C. Spectral
      properties and visual color were investigated during 6 h of heat treatment.
      Visual color was monitored from the CIEL*a*b* parameters. The remaining
      absorbance at maximum wavelength and the total color difference were used to
      quantify color degradation. The rate of color degradation increased as the
      temperature rose. The results showed that the thermal degradation of the
      colorants followed a first-order reaction kinetics. The reaction rate constants
      and half-life periods were determined as being central to understanding the color
      degradation kinetics. The temperature-dependent degradation was adequately
      modeled on the Arrhenius equation. Activation energies ranged from 3.2 kJmol(-1) 
      (lutein) to 43.7 kJmol(-1) (Opuntia betaxanthins). ss-carotene and lutein
      exhibited high thermal stability, while betaxanthins and riboflavin degraded
      rapidly as temperature increased. Gardenia yellow and curcumin were in an
      intermediate position.

TI  - Hypocholesterolemic Effect and In Vitro Pancreatic Lipase Inhibitory Activity of 
      an Opuntia ficus-indica Extract.
PG  - 837452
LID - 10.1155/2015/837452 [doi]
AB  - Cholesterol control is fundamental for prevention of cardiovascular disorders. In
      this work, the hypocholesterolemic activity of an aqueous Opuntia ficus-indica
      extract (AOE) was tested in triton-induced mice. The inhibitory activity on
      pancreatic lipase enzyme was evaluated in vitro by the same extract. Furthermore,
      polyphenol content of the extract was evaluated. Hypercholesterolemia was induced
      in three groups of mice by intraperitoneal administration of Triton WR-1339.
      After induction of hypercholesterolemia, the groups were treated with an AOE (500
      mg/kg) and saline solution and the positive control group with orlistat,
      respectively. Cholesterol levels were measured 24 h later in peripheral blood.
      The levels of blood cholesterol after administration of AOE significantly
      decreased compared to negative control. The inhibitory activity of AOE on
      pancreatic lipase enzyme was evaluated at concentrations from 60 to 1000 mug/mL. 
      The AOE inhibited the pancreatic lipase with an IC50 = 588.5 mug/mL. The AOE had 
      a high content of polyphenolic compounds. These results show that AOE is able to 
      prevent hypercholesterolemia by pancreatic lipase inhibition, in part due to its 
      polyphenolic compounds.

TI  - Antioxidant Opuntia ficus-indica Extract Activates AHR-NRF2 Signaling and
      Upregulates Filaggrin and Loricrin Expression in Human Keratinocytes.
PG  - 1143-9
LID - 10.1089/jmf.2014.3396 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) is a cactus species widely used as an
      anti-inflammatory, antilipidemic, and hypoglycemic agent. It has been shown that 
      OFI extract (OFIE) inhibits oxidative stress in animal models of diabetes and
      hepatic disease; however, its antioxidant mechanism remains largely unknown. In
      this study, we demonstrated that OFIE exhibited potent antioxidant activity
      through the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and 
      the downstream antioxidant enzyme NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), which
      inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen species in keratinocytes challenged
      with tumor necrosis factor alpha or benzo[alpha]pyrene. The antioxidant capacity 
      of OFIE was canceled in NRF2 knockdown keratinocytes. OFIE exerted this NRF2-NQO1
      upregulation through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Moreover,
      the ligation of AHR by OFIE upregulated the expression of epidermal barrier
      proteins: filaggrin and loricrin. OFIE also prevented TH2 cytokine-mediated
      downregulation of filaggrin and loricrin expression in an AHR-dependent manner
      because it was canceled in AHR knockdown keratinocytes. Antioxidant OFIE is a
      potent activator of AHR-NRF2-NQO1 signaling and may be beneficial in treating
      barrier-disrupted skin disorders.

AB  - The extraction, purification and degradation of polysaccharides from Opuntia
      ficus indica cladodes, as well as the evaluation of their antioxidant and
      antiglycated activities in vitro were investigated. The optimization of the
      extraction showed that extraction by ultrasound at 40 degrees C presented the
      best carbohydrates yield. The degradation of the extracted polysaccharides was
      achieved by free radical depolymerization with H2O2 in the presence of copper(II)
      acetate for various reaction times. Sugar contents were determined by
      colorimetric assays. The macromolecular characteristics of the different isolated
      and degraded carbohydrates were carried by size exclusion chromatography
      (SEC/MALS/VD/DRI). These experiments showed that all samples are polysaccharides,
      which are probably pectins and that molecular weight (Mw) has decreased from
      6,800,000 to 14,000 g/mol after 3 h of depolymerization without changing the
      structure. Preliminary antioxidant and antiglycated tests indicated that degraded
      polysaccharides for 2 and 3 h showed even better antioxidant and antiglycated
      activities.

      pads from Opuntia dillenii and Opuntia ficus indica. The physicochemical
      characteristics of both species were clearly different. There were important
      differences between the orange and green fruit pulp of O. ficus indica; the
      cactus pads of O. dillenii could be differentiated according to the region (North
      and South). Consumption of cactus pads contributes to the intake of dietary
      fiber, total phenolic compounds, K, Mg, Mn and Cr. Applying factor and/or
      discriminant analysis, the cactus pad samples were clearly differentiated
      according to the species, the fruit pulp color and production region.

TI  - Comparative study of antioxidant power, polyphenols, flavonoids and betacyanins
      of peel and pulp of three Tunisian Opuntia forms.
PG  - 650-8
AB  - The antioxidant activity and the chemical composition of methanol extracts from
      peel and pulp belonging to two species of Tunisian prickly pears Opuntia ficus
      indica (spiny and thornless forms) and Opuntia stricta has been studied. The
      antioxidant capacity was measured by DPPH radical scavenging activity. The Total 
      Phenolic Compound (TPC) and the total flavonoid content were determined by the
      Folin-Ciocalteu method and colorimetric method, respectively. The phenolic
      compounds were identified and quantified by High Performance Liquid
      Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with an electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
      (ESI-MS). The results showed that O. stricta fruits present the best antioxidant 
      activities than the two forms of O. ficus indica while the TPC was more important
      in O. ficus indica than in the O. stricta fruits. The peels have higher
      flavonoids than pulps and the thornless has more flavonoid than the spiny. The
      RP-HPLC and ESI-MS analysis detected two classes of phenolic compounds and
      betalain pigments. Isorhamnetin derivatives are the dominant flavonol glycoside
      identified in O. ficus indica (spiny: 65.25 mug g(-1); thornless: 77.03 mug
      g(-1)) and O. stricta peels (19.22 mug g(-1)).

AB  - The microencapsulation of betalains from cactus fruit by spray drying was
      evaluated as a stabilization strategy for these pigments. The betalains used as
      active agent were extracted from purple fruits of Opuntia ficus-indica (BE) and
      encapsulated with maltodextrin and cladode mucilage MD-CM and only with MD. The
      microcapsulates were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal
      analysis (TGA-DSC), tristimulus colorimetry, as well as, their humidity, water
      activity and dietary fiber content were also determined. The active agent content
      was measured by UV-Vis spectrophotometry and its composition confirmed by
      HPLC-ESIMS. A pigment storage stability test was performed at 18 degrees C and
      different relative humidities. The addition of CM in the formulation increased
      the encapsulation efficiency, diminished the moisture content, and allowed to
      obtain more uniform size and spherical particles, with high dietary fiber
      content. These microencapsulates are promising functional additive to be used as 
      natural colorant in the food industry.

AB  - There is a lack of information on the potential use of xoconostle cultivars as
      sources of antioxidants for food, pharmaceutical and colorant industries. The aim
      of this study was to provide a phytochemical characterisation and antioxidant
      activity evaluation of Opuntia matudae Scheinvar cv. Rosa by-products (epicarp
      and endocarp mucilage's), in order to evaluate their interest as sources of
      functional ingredients for human or animal foods. These by-products showed a high
      content in glucose, citric and linoleic acids, tocopherols, and
      isorhamnetin-O-(di-deoxyhexosyl-hexoside) (mainly in epicarp), and presented
      relevant antioxidant properties. The obtained results support the use of O.
      matudae Scheinvar cv. Rosa agro-industrial by-products as functional food
      ingredients, namely for antioxidant-enriched formulations, instead of being
      discarded.

TI  - Effect of fiber fractions of prickly pear cactus (nopal) on quality and sensory
      properties of wheat bread rolls.
PG  - 2990-7
LID - 10.1007/s13197-014-1341-7 [doi]
AB  - In this study the addition of total fiber (TF), insoluble fiber (IF), and soluble
      fiber (SF) from nopal to wheat flour used to make bread rolls was assessed. The
      rheological properties of dough as well as quality, texture, sensorial and
      physical characteristics of the crumb rolls produced were evaluated. The storage 
      (23.50 MPa) and loss modulus (11.95 MPa) for SF-dough were the lowest indicating 
      that a less visco-elastic behavior was obtained. Polarized light microscopy
      showed that a more homogeneous size and a better distribution of starch granules 
      were developed into SF-dough. Crumb hardness (3.25-4.78 N) and chewiness
      (0.31-0.81 N) of SF-rolls were lower than the control experiment (3.99-5.81 N and
      0.35-1.01 N respectively). Springiness for all treatments was constant (1.0)
      compared with the control (1.02-0.87) for 2 days of storage. The lowest
      cohesiveness values (0.24-014) were computed by IF treatment for a similar
      storage time. The specific crumb volume increased by 12.46, 9.03 and 1.10 % by
      the addition of SF, TF and IF respectively. The lowest rate of staling was shown 
      by SF-rolls (0.199) and it was followed by TF (0.296), IF (0.381) and control
      (0.458) treatments. As a result, the highest scores on quality (9.3 out of 10)
      and sensorial attributes (from 8.9 up to 9.7) were assigned to SF-rolls.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of potentially active nutrients and their
      multifunctional properties make prickly pear a perfect candidate for the
      production of phytopharmaceutical products. Among the numerous Opuntia species,
      bioactive compounds have been isolated and characterized primarily from Opuntia
      ficus-indica, Opuntia polycantha, Opuntia stricta, Opuntia dilleni for various
      medicinal properties. OBJECTIVE: Based on the traditional use of prickly pear for
      enhancement of immune function, the objective of the present study to evaluate
      the effect of prickly pear on mast cell degranulation function. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The Opuntia fruit juice (OFJ) (10-200 mul/ml) were studied for the
      effect on sensitized rat peritoneal mast cell degranulation induced by
      immunological (egg albumin), and nonimmunological (compound 48/80) stimuli and
      compared with that of the reference standard, sodium cromoglycate and ketotifen
      (10 mug/ml). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The OFJ exhibited significantly (P < 0.001) 
      concentration dependent inhibition of mast cell degranulation. The IC50 value of 
      OFJ was found 12.24 and 18 mul/ml for immunological and nonimmunological induced 
      mast cell degranulation, respectively. The betacyanin is an active principle
      compound in prickly pear that may responsible for mast cell stabilizing action.

TI  - Development and use of bioenergy feedstocks for semi-arid and arid lands.
PG  - 4177-93
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erv087 [doi]
AB  - Global climate change is predicted to increase heat, drought, and soil-drying
      conditions, and thereby increase crop sensitivity to water vapour pressure
      deficit, resulting in productivity losses. Increasing competition between
      agricultural freshwater use and municipal or industrial uses suggest that crops
      with greater heat and drought durability and greater water-use efficiency will be
      crucial for sustainable biomass production systems in the future. Agave
      (Agavaceae) and Opuntia (Cactaceae) represent highly water-use efficient
      bioenergy crops that could diversify bioenergy feedstock supply yet preserve or
      expand feedstock production into semi-arid, abandoned, or degraded agricultural
      lands, and reclaim drylands. Agave and Opuntia are crassulacean acid metabolism
      species that can achieve high water-use efficiencies and grow in water-limited
      areas with insufficient precipitation to support traditional C3 or C4 bioenergy
      crops. Both Agave and Opuntia have the potential to produce above-ground biomass 
      rivalling that of C3 and C4 crops under optimal growing conditions. The low
      lignin and high amorphous cellulose contents of Agave and Opuntia lignocellulosic
      biomass will be less recalcitrant to deconstruction than traditional feedstocks, 
      as confirmed by pretreatments that improve saccharification of Agave. Refined
      environmental productivity indices and geographical information systems modelling
      have provided estimates of Agave and Opuntia biomass productivity and terrestrial
      sequestration of atmospheric CO2; however, the accuracy of such modelling efforts
      can be improved through the expansion of field trials in diverse geographical
      settings. Lastly, life cycle analysis indicates that Agave would have
      productivity, life cycle energy, and greenhouse gas balances comparable or
      superior to those of traditional bioenergy feedstocks, but would be far more
      water-use efficient.

AB  - CONTEXT: Vinegar has long been used as a condiment and a traditional medicine
      worldwide. OBJECTIVE: The current study investigates the antioxidant effect of
      three types of fruit vinegars (FV) namely pomegranate [Punica granatum L.
      (Punicaceae)], prickly pear [Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill. (Cactaceae)], and
      apple [Malus domestica Borkh. (Rosaceae)] vinegars in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced
      hyperlipidemic Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty male Wistar rats were
      divided into five groups; HFD (80 cal/d) fed rats were orally dosed with fruit
      vinegars (7 ml/kg) once daily for 28 weeks. At the end of the experiment, lipid
      profile, lipid peroxidation products, antioxidant enzymes, and trace elements
      were assessed in serum. In addition, a liver histopathological study was
      performed. RESULTS: HFD showed a significant increase (p </= 0.05) in lipid
      profile and TBARS levels when compared with normal control. Daily oral
      administration of FV normalized various biochemical, metabolic, and
      histopathological changes. However, pomegranate vinegar exhibited a very
      significant (p </= 0.001) reduction in lipid profile levels (total cholesterol:
      165%, triglycerides: 68%, LDL-c: 76%, and atherogenic index: 80%), whereas an
      increase in antioxidant status (SOD: 7-fold, GPx: 4.81-fold, GRx: 1.66-fold, and 
      TAS: 3.45-fold) when compared with hyperlipidemic control. Histopathological
      examinations also confirmed the protective effects of pomegranate vinegar against
      lipid accumulation and the improvement of hepatic lesions. DISCUSSION AND
      CONCLUSION: The fruit vinegars regulate lipid metabolism and decrease liver
      damage in high-fat fed rats as shown in this study.

AB  - The endophytic fungal community associated with the native cactus Opuntia
      humifusa in the United States was investigated and its potential for providing
      antifungal compounds. A hundred-eight endophytic fungal isolates were obtained
      and identified by molecular methods into 17 different taxa of the genera
      Alternaria, Aureobasidium, Biscogniauxia, Cladosporium, Cryptococcus, Curvularia,
      Diaporthe, Epicoccum, Paraconiothyrium, Pestalotiopsis and Phoma. The most
      frequent species associated with O. humifusa were Alternaria sp. 3, Aureobasidium
      pullulans and Diaporthe sp. The fungal community of O. humifusa had a high
      richness and diversity; additionally, the species richness obtained indicates
      that the sample effort was enough to recover the diversity pattern obtained. Six 
      extracts of endophytes showed antifungal properties and (1)H NMR analyses of the 
      extracts of Alternaria sp. 5 Ohu 8B2, Alternaria sp. 3 Ohu 30A, Cladosporium
      funiculosum Ohu 17C1 and Paraconiothyrium sp. Ohu 17A indicated the presence of
      functional groups associated with unsaturated fatty-acid olefinic protons and
      fatty acid methylene and methyl protons. GC-FID analysis of these extracts
      confirmed the presence of a mixture of different fatty acids. The (1)H NMR
      analyses of Biscogniauxia mediterranea Ohu 19B extracts showed the presence of
      aromatic compounds. From the extract of B. mediterranea we isolated the compound 
      5-methylmellein that displayed moderate antifungal activity against the
      phytopathogenic fungi Phomopsis obscurans. Our results suggest that native
      medicinal cacti of the United States can live symbiotically with rich and diverse
      endophytic communities and may be a source of bioactive molecules, including
      those able to inhibit or control plant disease pathogens.

TI  - Antiatherogenic and antitumoral properties of Opuntia cladodes: inhibition of low
      density lipoprotein oxidation by vascular cells, and protection against the
      cytotoxicity of lipid oxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal in a colorectal cancer
      cellular model.

AB  - Opuntia species have been used for thousands of years as a folk medicine in the
      treatment of diseases. However, the components and protective mechanisms are
      still unclear. We make the hypothesis that Opuntia species may protect the
      development of oxidative stress-associated diseases, such as atherosclerosis or
      colon cancer, via their antioxidant properties. We investigated the protective
      effect of Opuntia cladode powder against the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL) evoked by vascular endothelial cells, an important risk factor for
      atherosclerosis development, and the toxicity of 4-hydroxynonenal (a major lipid 
      peroxidation product) on normal (Apc +/+) and preneoplastic (Apc min/+)
      immortalized epithelial colon cells. Various Opuntia species classified according
      to their degree of domestication, from the wildest (Opuntia streptacantha,
      Opuntia hyptiacantha, Opuntia megacantha), medium (Opuntia albicarpa), to the
      most domesticated (Opuntia ficus-indica) were tested. Cladode powders prepared
      from these Opuntia species significantly inhibited LDL oxidation induced by
      incubation with murine endothelial cells and the subsequent foam cell formation
      of RAW 264.7 murine macrophages and cytotoxicity on murine endothelial cells.
      Moreover, Opuntia cladode powder blocked the promotion of colon cancer
      development on an in vitro model of colonocytes. It may be noted that the
      phenolic acid and flavonoids content, the antioxidant capacity, and the
      protective effect were relatively similar in all the cladode powders from wild
      (O. streptacantha) and domesticated Opuntia. Altogether, these data confirm the
      therapeutic potential of Opuntia cladodes in diseases associated with oxidative
      stress.

AB  - In this study, a novel water-soluble polysaccharide fraction with molecular
      weight of 6479.1kDa was isolated from the fruits of Opuntia dillenii Haw., which 
      consisted of rhamnose, xylose, mannose and glucose in the molar ratio of
      14.99:1.14:1.00:6.47. The protective effect of O. dillenii Haw. fruits
      polysaccharide (ODFP) against oxidative damage in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced
      diabetic rats was investigated. The results showed that oral administration of
      ODFP significantly decreased food intake, water intake, urine production, organ
      weights and blood glucose level, and increased body weight in STZ-induced
      diabetic rats. ODFP also significantly increased the activities of SOD, GPx and
      CAT, and decreased malondialdehyde level in serum, liver, kidney, and pancreas in
      STZ-induced diabetic rats. Moreover, histopathological examination showed that
      ODFP could markedly improve the structure integrity of pancreatic islet tissue in
      STZ-induced diabetic rats. These results suggest that ODFP have hypoglycemic and 
      antioxidant properties and can protect rats from STZ-induced oxidative damage.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hundreds of dietary supplements are currently marketed as weight loss
      supplements. However, the advertised health claims of effectiveness for most of
      these have not been proven. The aim of this study was to critically appraise and 
      evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of cactus pear, Opuntia ficus-indica
      (OFI), using data from published randomized clinical trials. METHODS: We
      conducted electronic searches in Medline, Embase, Amed, Cinahl, and the Cochrane 
      Library. No restrictions on age, time, or language were imposed. The risk for
      bias in the studies included was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration
      criteria. Two reviewers independently determined the eligibility of included
      studies, assessed reporting quality, and extracted data. RESULTS: We identified
      seven eligible studies, of which five were included. The studies varied in design
      and reporting quality. Meta-analysis revealed a nonsignificant difference in body
      weight between OFI and controls (mean difference = -0.83 kg; 95% confidence
      interval, -2.49 to 0.83; I(2) = 93%). Significant reductions in body mass index, 
      percentage body fat, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and total
      cholesterol were observed. Adverse events included gastric intolerance and flu
      symptoms. CONCLUSION: The evidence from randomized clinical trials does not
      indicate that supplementation with OFI generates statistically significant
      effects on body weight. Consumption of OFI can cause significant reductions in
      percentage body fat, blood pressure, and total cholesterol. Few clinical trials
      evaluating the effects of OFI have been published. They vary in design and
      methodology, and are characterized by inconsistent quality of reporting. Further 
      clinical trials evaluating the effects of OFI on body composition and metabolic
      parameters are warranted.

      Opuntia ficus-indica.
PG  - 847320
LID - 10.1155/2015/847320 [doi]
AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) has been widely used in Mexico as a food and for the
      treatment of different health disorders such as inflammation and skin aging. Its 
      biological properties have been attributed to different phytochemicals such as
      the isorhamnetin glycosides which are the most abundant flavonoids. Moreover,
      these compounds are considered a chemotaxonomic characteristic of OFI species.
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of OFI extract and its
      isorhamnetin glycosides on different inflammatory markers in vitro and in vivo.
      OFI extract was obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of OFI cladodes powder and pure
      compounds were obtained by preparative chromatography. Nitric oxide (NO),
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) alpha, and interleukin-
      (IL-) 6 production were measured. NO production was tested in
      lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells while in vivo studies were carried 
      on croton oil-induced ear edema model. OFI extract and diglycoside
      isorhamnetin-glucosyl-rhamnoside (IGR) at 125 ng/mL suppressed the NO production 
      in vitro (73.5 +/- 4.8% and 68.7 +/- 5.0%, resp.) without affecting cell
      viability. Likewise, IGR inhibited the ear edema (77.4 +/- 5.7%) equating the
      indomethacin effects (69.5 +/- 5.3%). Both IGR and OFI extract significantly
      inhibited the COX-2, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 production. IGR seems to be a suitable
      natural compound for development of new anti-inflammatory ingredient.

AB  - Sulfated and pyruvylated galactans were isolated from three tropical species of
      the Bryopsidales, Penicillus capitatus, Udotea flabellum, and Halimeda opuntia.
      They represent the only important sulfated polysaccharides present in the cell
      walls of these highly calcified seaweeds of the suborder Halimedineae. Their
      structural features were studied by chemical analyses and NMR spectroscopy. Their
      backbone comprises 3-, 6-, and 3,6-linkages, constituted by major amounts of
      3-linked 4,6-O-(1'-carboxy)ethylidene-d-galactopyranose units in part sulfated on
      C-2. Sulfation on C-2 was not found in galactans from other seaweeds of this
      order. In addition, a complex sulfation pattern, comprising also 4-, 6-, and
      4,6-disulfated galactose units was found. A fraction from P. capitatus, F1,
      showed a moderate anticoagulant activity, evaluated by general coagulation tests 
      and also kinetics of fibrin formation was assayed. Besides, preliminary results
      suggest that one of the possible mechanisms involved is direct thrombin
      inhibition.

AB  - Phenolic content is a primary parameter for vegetables oil quality evaluation,
      and directly involved in the prevention of oxidation and oil preservation.
      Several methods have been reported in the literature for polyphenols extraction
      from seed oil but the approaches commonly used remain manually handled. In this
      work, we propose a rapid and sensitive method for seed oil polyphenols extraction
      and identification. For this purpose, polyphenols were extracted from Opuntia
      stricta Haw seed oil, using high frequency agitation, separated, and then
      identified using a liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry
      method. Our results showed good sensitivity and reproducibility of the developed 
      methods.

TI  - Genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship among Tunisian cactus species
      (Opuntia) as revealed by random amplified microsatellite polymorphism markers.
PG  - 1423-33
LID - 10.4238/2015.February.13.21 [doi]
AB  - Opuntia ficus indica is one of the most economically important species in the
      Cactaceae family. Increased interest in this crop stems from its potential
      contribution to agricultural diversification, application in the exploitation of 
      marginal lands, and utility as additional income sources for farmers. In Tunisia,
      O. ficus indica has been affected by drastic genetic erosion resulting from
      biotic and abiotic stresses. Thus, it is imperative to identify and preserve this
      germplasm. In this study, we focused on the use of random amplified
      microsatellite polymorphisms to assess genetic diversity among 25 representatives
      of Tunisian Opuntia species maintained in the collection of the National
      Institute of Agronomic Research of Tunisia. Seventy-two DNA markers were screened
      to discriminate accessions using 16 successful primer combinations. The high
      percentage of polymorphic band (100%), the resolving power value (5.68), the
      polymorphic information content (0.94), and the marker index (7.2) demonstrated
      the efficiency of the primers tested. Therefore, appropriate cluster analysis
      used in this study illustrated a divergence among the cultivars studied and
      exhibited continuous variation that occurred independently of geographic origin. 
      O. ficus indica accessions did not cluster separately from the other cactus pear 
      species, indicating that their current taxonomical classifications are not well
      aligned with their genetic variability or locality of origin.

PG  - 448-52
LID - 10.1007/s00128-015-1498-4 [doi]
AB  - The accumulation and biotransformation of vanadium (V) in Opuntia microdasys were
      investigated under hydroponic conditions to determine the toxicity of pentavalent
      V [i.e., V(V)] to the plant and the mechanism of tolerance by the plant to V.
      Results showed that the concentration of V(V) in nutrient solution was negatively
      correlated to plant biomass. Moreover, the water content of cladodes decreased
      under V(V) stress. In V(V)-treated plants, most of the adsorbed V remained in the
      roots and in the cell wall compartment. In the cladodes, the ratios of V(V) to
      Vtotal were lower in V(V)-treated plants than those in the control plants. These 
      results indicate that a high concentration of V(V) is toxic to O. microdasys but 
      that the plants may limit this toxicity through the compartmentalization of V in 
      the cell wall and the biotransformation of V from V(V) to tetravalent V [i.e.,
      V(IV)].

TI  - Hurdle technology applied to prickly pear beverages for inhibiting Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae and Escherichia coli.
PG  - 558-64
LID - 10.1111/lam.12406 [doi]
AB  - The effect of pH reduction (from 6.30-6.45 to 4.22-4.46) and the addition of
      antimicrobial compounds (sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate) on the inhibition
      of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli in prickly pear beverages
      formulated with the pulp and peel of Villanueva (V, Opuntia albicarpa) and Rojo
      Vigor (RV, Opuntia ficus-indica) varieties during 14 days of storage at 25
      degrees C, was evaluated. RV variety presented the highest microbial inhibition. 
      By combining pH reduction and preservatives, reductions of 6.2-log10 and
      2.3-log10 for E. coli and S. cerevisiae were achieved respectively. Due to the
      low reduction of S. cerevisiae, pulsed electric fields (PEF) (11-15 mus/25-50
      Hz/27-36 kV cm(-1)) was applied as another preservation factor. The combination
      of preservatives, pH reduction and PEF at 13-15 mus/25-50 Hz for V variety, and
      11 mus/50 Hz, 13-15 mus/25-50 Hz for RV, had a synergistic effect on S.
      cerevisiae inhibition, achieving at least 3.4-log10 of microbial reduction
      immediately after processing, and more than 5-log10 at fourth day of storage at
      25 degrees C maintained this reduction during 21 days of storage (P > 0.05).
      Hurdle technology using PEF in combination with other factors is adequate to
      maintain stable prickly pear beverages during 21 days/25 degrees C. Significance 
      and impact of the study: Prickly pear is a fruit with functional value, with high
      content of nutraceuticals and antioxidant activity. Functional beverages
      formulated with the pulp and peel of this fruit represent an alternative for its 
      consumption. Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are micro-organisms
      that typically affect fruit beverage quality and safety. The food industry is
      looking for processing technologies that maintain quality without compromising
      safety. Hurdle technology, including pulsed electric fields (PEF) could be an
      option to achieve this. The combination of PEF, pH reduction and preservatives is
      an alternative to obtain safe and minimally processed prickly pear beverages with
      convenient shelf-life.

AB  - In the present study, we have adapted a facile and efficient green route for the 
      synthesis of HAP nanoparticles using pectin as a template which was extracted
      from the peel of prickly pear (Opuntia ficus indica) fruits. The concentration of
      pectin plays a major role in the behavior of crystallinity, purity, morphology as
      well as biological property of the as-synthesized HAP nanoparticles. The
      extracted pectin and the as-synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by
      various analytical techniques. The in vitro apatite formation on the surface of
      the as-synthesized nanoparticles in simulated body fluid (SBF) for various days
      showed an enhanced bioactivity. Also, the antimicrobial activity was investigated
      using various microorganisms. All the results revealed the formation of pure, low
      crystalline and discrete granular like HAP nanoparticles of size around 25 nm
      with enhanced biological and antimicrobial activities. Hence the as-synthesized
      nanoparticles can act as a better bone regenerating material in the field of
      biomedicine.

TI  - Environmental factors and seasonal dynamics of Prorocentrum lima population in
      coastal waters of the Gulf of Tunis, South Mediterranean.
PG  - 2256-70
AB  - In the frame of a phytoplankton study, a series of samples were collected in the 
      Punic harbors of Carthage (Gulf of Tunis, South Mediterranean) from March 2008 to
      March 2010. Species composition, seasonal variations of pelagic Prorocentrum
      populations and several physico-chemical parameters were specified, as well as
      the relation between Prorocentrum species dynamics and water temperature,
      salinity and nutrient concentrations. The main detected species are included in
      the benthic/epiphytic group; P. lima (Ehrenberg) Stein 1878 and P. emarginatum
      Fukuyo 1981. P lima was the dominant species. The highest abundance of P. lima
      (6.97 x 10(3) Cells L(-1)) was recorded in August 2008 where temperature and
      salinity values ranged from 23.1 to 30.2 degrees C and 36.1 to 40.3 psu,
      respectively. The dynamics of the P. lima population had significant positive
      correlations with both temperature and salinity, and negative correlations with
      both nitrogen/phosphorus ratio and ammonium concentrations. Proliferations of
      this species represent a serious hazard for public health in Tunis northern
      coasts.

TI  - CO(2) and inorganic nutrient enrichment affect the performance of a calcifying
      green alga and its noncalcifying epiphyte.
PG  - 1157-69
LID - 10.1007/s00442-015-3242-5 [doi]
AB  - Ocean acidification studies in the past decade have greatly improved our
      knowledge of how calcifying organisms respond to increased surface ocean CO2
      levels. It has become evident that, for many organisms, nutrient availability is 
      an important factor that influences their physiological responses and competitive
      interactions with other species. Therefore, we tested how simulated ocean
      acidification and eutrophication (nitrate and phosphate enrichment) interact to
      affect the physiology and ecology of a calcifying chlorophyte macroalga (Halimeda
      opuntia (L.) J.V. Lamouroux) and its common noncalcifying epiphyte (Dictyota sp.)
      in a 4-week fully crossed multifactorial experiment. Inorganic nutrient
      enrichment (+NP) had a strong influence on all responses measured with the
      exception of net calcification. Elevated CO2 alone significantly decreased
      electron transport rates of the photosynthetic apparatus and resulted in
      phosphorus limitation in both species, but had no effect on oxygen production or 
      respiration. The combination of CO2 and +NP significantly increased electron
      transport rates in both species. While +NP alone stimulated H. opuntia growth
      rates, Dictyota growth was significantly stimulated by nutrient enrichment only
      at elevated CO2, which led to the highest biomass ratios of Dictyota to Halimeda.
      Our results suggest that inorganic nutrient enrichment alone stimulates several
      aspects of H. opuntia physiology, but nutrient enrichment at a CO2 concentration 
      predicted for the end of the century benefits Dictyota sp. and hinders its
      calcifying basibiont H. opuntia.

TI  - Effects of cooking methods on phenolic compounds in xoconostle (Opuntia
      joconostle).
PG  - 85-90
LID - 10.1007/s11130-014-0465-2 [doi]
AB  - Xoconostle, the acidic cactus pear fruit of Opuntia joconostle of the Cactaceae
      family, is the source of several phytochemicals, such as betalain pigments and
      numerous phenolic compounds. The aim of the present study was to analyze the
      effect of four cooking procedures (i.e., boiling, grilling, steaming and
      microwaving) on the total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity
      (measured by ABTS, DPPH, reducing power, and BCBA) of xoconostle. In addition,
      HPLC-DAD analyses were performed to identify and quantify individual phenolic
      compounds. After microwaving and steaming xoconostle, the TPC remained the same
      that in fresh samples, whereas both grilling and boiling produced a significant, 
      20% reduction (p </= 0.05). Total flavonoids remained unchanged in boiled and
      grilled xoconostle, but steaming and microwaving increased the flavonoid content 
      by 13 and 20%, respectively. Steaming and microwaving did not produce significant
      changes in the antioxidant activity of xoconostle, whereas boiling and grilling
      result in significant decreases. The phenolic acids identified in xoconostle
      fruits were gallic, vanillic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, syringic, ferulic and
      protocatechuic acids; the flavonoids identified were epicatechin, catechin,
      rutin, quercitrin, quercetin and kaempferol. Based on the results, steaming and
      microwaving are the most suitable methods for retaining the highest level of
      phenolic compounds and flavonoids in xoconostle.

PG  - 343-50
LID - 10.1007/s13197-013-0989-8 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize Opuntia robusta parenchyma and mucilage
      as foodstuffs. Solute absorption of Opuntia robusta parenchyma was studied,
      mucilage was used to develop a mayonnaise-like product as substitute emulsifier
      alternative to egg yolk and oil substitute. Shelf life of mayonnaise-like product
      was evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that oxalate calcium
      crystal were present in the Opuntia robusta parenchyma and mucilage with druses
      morphology; whereas that in the mayonnaise-like product were not observed calcium
      oxalate crystals, due probably to the product pH is acidic. The heat treatment of
      parenchyma at 50 degrees C, 65 degrees Brix, had highest influence on the solute 
      absorption (about 35 %). Results revealed that best mixture was the formulated
      with 26.79 % oil, 62.50 % mucilage and 10.71 % whey protein. Mucilage was the
      component showing the highest effect on all textural characteristics of
      mayonnaise-like product. The storage temperature had highest effect on the
      textural characteristics of mayonnaise-like product than storage time. With the
      right combination of mucilage of Opuntia, oil and whey protein, it is possible to
      develop a low-fat mayonnaise with functional properties similar to those of
      commercial mayonnaise.

TI  - The effect of isorhamnetin glycosides extracted from Opuntia ficus-indica in a
      mouse model of diet induced obesity.
PG  - 805-15
LID - 10.1039/c4fo01092b [doi]
AB  - A diet rich in polyphenols can ameliorate some metabolic alterations associated
      with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) is a plant rich in
      isorhamnetin glycosides and is highly consumed in Mexico. The purpose of this
      research was to determine the metabolic effect of an OFI extract on a mouse model
      of diet-induced obesity and in isolated pancreatic islets. OFI extract was added 
      to a high fat (HF) diet at a low (0.3%) or high (0.6%) dose and administered to
      C57BL/6 mice for 12 weeks. Mice fed the HF diet supplemented with the OFI extract
      gained less body weight and exhibited significantly lower circulating total
      cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol compared to those fed the HF
      diet alone. The HF-OFI diet fed mice presented lower glucose and insulin
      concentration than the HF diet fed mice. However, the HF-OFI diet fed mice tended
      to have higher insulin concentration than control mice. The OFI extract
      stimulated insulin secretion in vitro, associated with increased glucose
      transporter 2 (GLUT2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
      (PPARgamma) mRNA content. Furthermore, the OFI extract improved glucose
      tolerance, and additionally increased energy expenditure. These metabolic
      improvements were associated with reduced adipocyte size, increased hepatic IRS1 
      tyr-608 and S6 K thr-389 phosphorylation. OFI isorhamnetin glycosides also
      diminished the hepatic lipid content associated with reduced mRNA expression of
      the endoplasmic reticulum stress markers and lipogenic enzymes and increased mRNA
      expression of genes related to fatty acid oxidation. Overall, the OFI extract
      prevented the development of metabolic abnormalities associated with diet-induced
      obesity.

TI  - THE POTENTIAL FOR USING ENTOMOPATHOGENIC NEMATODES TO CONTROL DARKWINGED FUNGUS
      GNATS BRADYSIA COPROPHILA (LINTNER) ON SUCCULENTS IN GLASS HOUSES.
PG  - 41-5
AB  - Darkwinged fungus gnat Bradysia coprophila Lintner (Diptera: Sciaridae) is known 
      as a pest of ornamental plants in commercial green and glass houses in nurseries 
      worldwide. There have been reports about significant Bradysia coprophila damage
      of succulent plants in five Botanical gardens in Ukraine, including Academician
      Fomin's Botanical garden (Kiev) for the last three years. In pot experiments the 
      commercial strain of S.feltiae to control B. coprophila was tested on Mammilaria,
      Opuntia, Echinocerus plants grown individually in plastic pots at rate 500,000
      IJs/m(2). Efficacy of EPN was evaluated based on the percentage of fly emergence 
      from compost and captured in yellow sticky traps in treated and untreated benches
      with pots. It was shown that Steinernema feltiae application causes significant
      reduction (90%) of flies captured in yellow traps in comparison with the control.
      To evaluate virulence of EPNs to B. coprophila in laboratory bioassays, fourth
      instar larvae were exposed to 20, 50, 75, 100 IJs. B. coprophila was susceptible 
      to all commercial and wild isolates of Steinernema and Heterorhabditis spp.
      Percentage mortality of B. coprophila larva ranged between 49 and 95%. Wild and
      commercial isolates of S. feltiae were highly virulent to the pest. The highest
      mortality--95% was obtained by using a wild strain of S. feltice. The nematode
      concentration tills to 50 IJ and all nematode species significantly affected the 
      mortality rate of B. coprophila. Increasing the dosage of Steinernema spp. from
      75 to 100 IJs did not affect significantly the mortality rate of the insect.

TI  - Semiochemicals from ex situ abiotically stressed cactus tissue: a contributing
      role of fungal spores?
PG  - 12273-6
LID - 10.1021/jf505735g [doi]
AB  - Semiochemicals play a central role in communication between plants and insects,
      such as signaling the location of a suitable host. Fungi on host plants can also 
      play an influential role in communicating certain plant vulnerabilities to an
      insect. The spiroketal conophthorin is an important semiochemical produced by
      developing fungal spores. Spiroketals are also used as signals for scolytid
      communication. Plants and fungi are known to emit varying volatile profiles under
      biotic and abiotic stress. This paper reports distinctive temporal-volatile
      profiles from three abiotic treatments, room temperature (control), -15 degrees C
      (cold), and -15 degrees C to room temperature (shock), of cactus tissue plugs.
      Volatiles from the three treatments included monoterpenes from control plugs,
      compounds of varying classes and origin at later stages for cold plugs, and known
      semiochemicals, including spiroketals, at later stages for shock plugs. The
      results highlight several important findings: a unique tissue source of the
      spiroketals; abiotic cold-shock stress is indicated as the cause of spiroketal
      production; and, given previous findings of spirogenesis, fungal spore
      involvement is a probable biosynthetic origin of the spiroketals. These findings 
      suggest an important role of fungal volatiles as signaling plant vulnerability to
      insects.

AB  - This study falls within the framework of the industrial exploitation of
      by-products of the prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica). The study aims to
      evaluate the use of hydro-ethanolic extract of prickly pear peels as a substitute
      of vitamin E used as antioxidant in margarine preservation. The extract was rich 
      in total phenolics (1512.58 mg GAE/100 g DM). HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS(n) analyses allowed
      the identification of sixteen compounds belonging to hydroxybenzoic acids,
      hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids. The extract displayed a reducing power and 
      an antiradical activity that were respectively similar to and lower than the two 
      antioxidant standards quercetin and butylated hydroxyanisole. Tests conducted at 
      laboratory and pilot scales showed that the margarines elaborated with peel
      extract were more resistant to oxidation than the margarine reference with
      vitamin E. In addition, neither the physicochemical nor the microbiological
      properties were modified. Prickly pear peels contain bioactive substances that
      could be used in different food sectors.

TI  - Characterization of crystalline structures in Opuntia ficus-indica.
PG  - 99-112
LID - 10.1007/s10867-014-9368-6 [doi]
AB  - This research studies the crystalline compounds present in nopal (Opuntia
      ficus-indica) cladodes. The identification of the crystalline structures was
      performed using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, mass
      spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The crystalline
      structures identified were calcium carbonate (calcite) [CaCO3], calcium-magnesium
      bicarbonate [CaMg(CO3)2], magnesium oxide [MgO], calcium oxalate monohydrate
      [Ca(C2O4)*(H2O)], potassium peroxydiphosphate [K4P2O8] and potassium chloride
      [KCl]. The SEM images indicate that calcite crystals grow to dipyramidal,
      octahedral-like, prismatic, and flower-like structures; meanwhile,
      calcium-magnesium bicarbonate structures show rhombohedral exfoliation and
      calcium oxalate monohydrate is present in a drusenoid morphology. These calcium
      carbonate compounds have a great importance for humans because their
      bioavailability. This is the first report about the identification and structural
      analysis of calcium carbonate and calcium-magnesium bicarbonate in nopal
      cladodes, as well as the presence of magnesium oxide, potassium peroxydiphosphate
      and potassium chloride in these plants. The significance of the study of the
      inorganic components of these cactus plants is related with the increasing
      interest in the potential use of Opuntia as a raw material of products for the
      food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries.

TI  - Anti-tumor effect of cactus polysaccharides on lung squamous carcinoma cells
      (SK-MES-1).
PG  - 99-104
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cactus polysaccharides are the active components of Opuntia dillenii 
      which have been used extensively in folk medicine. In this study, we investigate 
      the anti-tumor effect of cactus polysaccharides on lung squamous carcinoma cells 
      SK-MES-1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibitory effect of Cactus polysaccharides 
      on lung squamous carcinoma cells were detected by MTT assay. Cell cycle was
      determined by flow cytometry and cell apoptosis was determined by AnnexinV assay.
      Western-blotting was applied to detect P53 and PTEN protein expression in the
      cells treated with cactus polysaccharides. RESULTS: Results showed that different
      concentrations of wild cactus polysaccharides prevent SK-MES-1 cells growth and
      induces S phase arrest. The data also revealed that cactus polysaccharides cause 
      apoptosis in SK-MES-1 cells determined by Annexin-V assay. Furthermore, cactus
      polysaccharides induced growth arrest and apoptosis may be due to the increase of
      P53 and phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) protein.
      CONCLUSION: Cactus polysaccharides have anti-tumor activity on lung squamous
      carcinoma cells.

TI  - Anticancer properties of extracts from Opuntia humifusa against human cervical
      carcinoma cells.
PG  - 31-44
LID - 10.1089/jmf.2013.3096 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we found that the total polyphenol and ascorbic acid levels in the
      fruit of Opuntia humifusa are higher than those in other parts of the plant. We
      further hypothesized that antioxidants in O. humifusa might affect the growth or 
      survival of cancer cells. Hexane extracts of seeds and ethyl acetate extracts of 
      fruits and stems significantly suppressed the proliferation of HeLa cervical
      carcinoma cells, but did not affect the proliferation of normal human BJ
      fibroblasts. Additionally, the extracts of O. humifusa induced G1 phase arrest in
      HeLa cells. The O. humifusa extracts reduced the levels of G1 phase-associated
      cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), and phosphorylated retinoblastoma
      proteins. Moreover, p21(WAF1/Cip1) and p53 expression significantly increased
      after treatment. We examined the effects of ethyl acetate extracts of O. humifusa
      fruit (OHF) on HeLa cells xenograft tumor growth. OHF treatment significantly
      reduced tumor volume and this decrease was correlated with decreased Cdk4 and
      cyclin D1 expression. Furthermore, flavonoids, trans Taxifolin, and
      dihydrokaempferol, were isolated from OHF. Thus, this extract may be a promising 
      candidate for treating human cervical carcinoma.

TI  - Trail marking by larvae of the cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum.
PG  - 64
LID - 10.1093/jis/14.1.64 [doi]
LID - 64 [pii]
AB  - The cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), spends
      most of its larval life feeding within the cladodes of Opuntia cactuses, but the 
      gregarious caterpillars begin their life outside the plant, and in the later
      instars make intermittent excursions over plant surfaces to access new cladodes
      and to thermoregulate. The study reported here showed that when the caterpillars 
      move en masse, they mark and follow trails that serve to keep the cohort
      together. Artificial trails prepared from hexane extracts of the caterpillar's
      paired mandibular glands were readily followed by the caterpillars. The glands
      are remarkably large, and their fluid contents, which constitute approximately 1%
      of the total wet mass of a caterpillar, are secreted onto the substrate as they
      move. Although the caterpillars also lay down copious quantities of silk, the
      material in itself neither elicits trail following nor is it a requisite
      component of pathways that elicit trail following. Previous analyses of the
      mandibular glands of other species of pyralid caterpillars showed that they
      contain a series of structurally distinct 2-acyl-1,3 cyclohexane diones. Chemical
      analysis indicates that the glands of C. cactorum contain structurally similar
      compounds, and bio- assays indicate that trail following occurs in response to
      these chemicals. While the mandibular glands' fluids have been shown to act as
      semiochemicals, effecting both interspecific and intra- specific behavior in
      other species of pyralids, the present study is the first to report their use as 
      a trail pheromone.

TI  - Protein enrichment of an Opuntia ficus-indica cladode hydrolysate by cultivation 
      of Candida utilis and Kluyveromyces marxianus.
PG  - 1094-102
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.6985 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cladodes of Opuntia ficus-indica (prickly pear cactus) have a low
      protein content; for use as a balanced feed, supplementation with other protein
      sources is therefore desirable. We investigated protein enrichment by cultivation
      of the yeasts Candida utilis and Kluyveromyces marxianus in an enzymatic
      hydrolysate of the cladode biomass. RESULTS: Dilute acid pretreatment and
      enzymatic hydrolysis of sun-dried cladodes resulted in a hydrolysate containing
      (per litre) 45.5 g glucose, 6.3 g xylose, 9.1 g galactose, 10.8 g arabinose and
      9.6 g fructose. Even though K. marxianus had a much higher growth rate and
      utilized l-arabinose and d-galactose more completely than C. utilis, its biomass 
      yield coefficient was lower due to ethanol and ethyl acetate production despite
      aerobic cultivation. Yeast cultivation more than doubled the protein content of
      the hydrolysate, with an essential amino acid profile superior to sorghum and
      millet grains. CONCLUSIONS: This K. marxianus strain was weakly Crabtree
      positive. Despite its low biomass yield, its performance compared well with C.
      utilis. This is the first report showing that the protein content and quality of 
      O. ficus-indica cladode biomass could substantially be improved by yeast
      cultivation, including a comparative evaluation of C. utilis and K. marxianus.

TI  - miRNA expression during prickly pear cactus fruit development.
PG  - 435-48
LID - 10.1007/s00425-014-2193-0 [doi]
AB  - miRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. They
      are involved in the control of many developmental processes, including fruit
      development. The increasing amount of information on miRNAs, on their expression,
      abundance, and conservation between various species, provides a new opportunity
      to study the role of miRNAs in non-model plant species. In this work, we used a
      combination of Northern blot and tissue print hybridization analysis to identify 
      conserved miRNAs expressed during prickly pear cactus (Opuntia ficus indica)
      fruit development. Comparative profiling detected the expression of 34 miRNAs,
      which were clustered in three different groups that were associated with the
      different phases of fruit development. Variation in the level of miRNA expression
      was observed. Gradual expression increase of several miRNAs was observed during
      fruit development, including miR164. miR164 was selected for stem-loop RT-PCR and
      for a detailed spatial-temporal expression analysis. At early floral stages,
      miR164 was mainly localized in meristematic tissues, boundaries and fusion zones,
      while it was more homogenously expressed in fruit tissues. Our results provide
      the first evidence of miRNA expression in the prickly pear cactus and provide the
      basis for future research on miRNAs in Opuntia. Moreover, our analyses suggest
      that miR164 plays different roles during prickly pear cactus fruit development.

TI  - Review of natural products with hepatoprotective effects.
PG  - 14787-804
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i40.14787 [doi]
AB  - The liver is one of the most important organs in the body, performing a
      fundamental role in the regulation of diverse processes, among which the
      metabolism, secretion, storage, and detoxification of endogenous and exogenous
      substances are prominent. Due to these functions, hepatic diseases continue to be
      among the main threats to public health, and they remain problems throughout the 
      world. Despite enormous advances in modern medicine, there are no completely
      effective drugs that stimulate hepatic function, that offer complete protection
      of the organ, or that help to regenerate hepatic cells. Thus, it is necessary to 
      identify pharmaceutical alternatives for the treatment of liver diseases, with
      the aim of these alternatives being more effective and less toxic. The use of
      some plants and the consumption of different fruits have played basic roles in
      human health care, and diverse scientific investigations have indicated that, in 
      those plants and fruits so identified, their beneficial effects can be attributed
      to the presence of chemical compounds that are called phytochemicals. The present
      review had as its objective the collecting of data based on research conducted
      into some fruits (grapefruit, cranberries, and grapes) and plants [cactus pear
      (nopal) and cactus pear fruit, chamomile, silymarin, and spirulina], which are
      consumed frequently by humans and which have demonstrated hepatoprotective
      capacity, as well as an analysis of a resin (propolis) and some phytochemicals
      extracted from fruits, plants, yeasts, and algae, which have been evaluated in
      different models of hepatotoxicity.

TI  - Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of a flavonoid-rich concentrate
      recovered from Opuntia ficus-indica juice.
PG  - 3269-80
LID - 10.1039/c4fo00071d [doi]
AB  - In this work, Opuntia ficus indica juice was explored as a potential source of
      natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ingredients towards intestinal
      inflammation. An adsorption separation process was used to produce a natural
      flavonoid-rich concentrate (FRC) from Opuntia ficus-indica juice. The FRC effect 
      (co- or pre-incubation) on induced-oxidative stress and induced-inflammation was 
      evaluated in human Caco-2 cells. The main constituents identified and present in 
      the extract are flavonoids (namely isorhamnetins and their derivatives such as
      isorhamnetin 3-O-rhamnose-rutinoside and isorhamnetin 3-O-rutinoside) and
      phenolic acids (such as ferulic, piscidic and eucomic acids). Our results showed 
      that co-incubation of FRC with the stress-inducer attenuates radicals production 
      in a much more significant manner than pre-incubation. These results suggest that
      FRC compounds which cannot pass the cell membrane freely (isorhamnetin
      derivatives) have an ability to inhibit the formation of H2O2-induced radicals in
      the surrounding environment of intestinal epithelial cells. The capacity of FRC
      (co-incubation) for suppressing (at the extracellular level) free radicals chain 
      initiation or propagation reaction was probably related with a more pronounced
      reduction in protein oxidation. A similar response was observed in the
      inflammatory state, where a marked decrease in IL-8 secretion and blocked
      degradation of IkappaBalpha was achieved for FRC co-incubation. Simultaneously,
      treatment with FRC significantly reduces NO and TNF-alpha expression and
      modulates apparent permeability in Caco-2 cells. In these cases, no significant
      differences were found between pre- and co-incubation treatments suggesting that 
      bioavailable phenolics, such as ferulic, eucomic and piscidic acids and
      isorhamnetin, act at the intracellular environment.

TI  - A dehydrin-dehydrin interaction: the case of SK3 from Opuntia streptacantha.
PG  - 520
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2014.00520 [doi]
AB  - Dehydrins belongs to a large group of highly hydrophilic proteins known as Late
      Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins. It is well known that dehydrins are
      intrinsically disordered plant proteins that accumulate during the late stages of
      embryogenesis and in response to abiotic stresses; however, the molecular
      mechanisms by which their functions are carried out are still unclear. We have
      previously reported that transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing an Opuntia 
      streptacantha SK3 dehydrin (OpsDHN1) show enhanced tolerance to freezing stress. 
      Herein, we show using a split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system that OpsDHN1
      dimerizes. We found that the deletion of regions containing K-segments and the
      histidine-rich region in the OpsDHN1 protein affects dimer formation. Not
      surprisingly, in silico protein sequence analysis suggests that OpsDHN1 is an
      intrinsically disordered protein, an observation that was confirmed by circular
      dichroism and gel filtration of the recombinantly expressed protein. The addition
      of zinc triggered the association of recombinantly expressed OpsDHN1 protein,
      likely through its histidine-rich motif. These data brings new insights about the
      molecular mechanism of the OpsDHN1 SK3-dehydrin.

TI  - Bioactives in cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) stems possess potent antioxidant and 
      pro-apoptotic activities through COX-2 involvement.
PG  - 2601-6
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.6968 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioactives extracted from cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) stems were
      investigated for their chemopreventive activities using human cancer cells in
      vitro. The bioactives present in crude extracts were detected and quantified
      using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Among all the extracts,
      such as hexane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), acetone, methanol (MeOH), and MeOH:water
      (80:20), the MeOH extract had the highest amount of polyphenolic compounds and
      the acetone extract exhibited the most potent effect at scavenging the
      2,2,-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and
      2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS(*+) ) radical. In
      addition, most of the extracts, with the exception of hexane, exhibited
      significant cytotoxicity in human SW480 colon and MCF7 breast cancer cells.
      Overall, the SW480 cells were more sensitive than the MCF7 cells to the cytotoxic
      effect of the O. ficus-indica extracts (OFEs). Cell death by OFE treatment caused
      significant inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and increased the Bax/Bcl2 ratio in
      both SW480 and MCF7 cell lines. However, degradation of poly (ADP-ribose)
      polymerase was significantly increased by OFE only in the MCF7 cells, thereby
      inducing apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the health-benefit
      roles, including anti-oxidative and anti-proliferative activities as well as
      pro-apoptotic effects, of bioactive compounds in OFEs, suggesting a
      chemopreventive role in human cancer cells.

PG  - 1260-5
LID - 10.1366/14-07485 [doi]
AB  - To find markers that distinguish the different Cactaceae species, by using near
      infrared Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, we studied the
      occurrence, in the stem, of solid deposits in five Cactaceae species (Coryphantha
      clavata, Ferocactus latispinus, Opuntia ficus-indica, O. robusta, and O.
      strepthacantha) collected from their natural habitats from a region of Mexico.
      The deposits in the tissues usually occurred as spheroidal aggregates, druses, or
      prismatic crystals. From the Raman spectra, the crystals were identified either
      as calcium oxalate monohydrate (CaC2O4.H2O) or calcium oxalate dihydrate
      (CaC2O4.2H2O). Opuntia species (subfamily Opuntioideae) showed the presence of
      CaC2O4.H2O, and the deposition of CaC2O4.2H2O was present in C. clavata and F.
      latispinus (subfamily Cactoideae, Cacteae tribe). As a punctual technique, Raman 
      spectroscopy seems to be a useful tool to identify crystal composition. In
      addition to allowing the analysis of crystal morphology, this spectroscopic
      technique can be used to identify Cactaceae species and their chemotaxonomy.

TI  - EVALUATION OF FREEZE DRIED ALOE VERA AND NOPAL CACTUS FOR POSSIBLE HEALTH
      TREATMENTS BY COMPARISON OF ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES AND FREE RADICAL INHIBITION.
PG  - 67-70
AB  - The goal of this project was to characterize the antioxidant powers of
      lyophilized Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis) and Nopal Cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) 
      by quantifying the phenolics content and radical scavenging abilities of
      preparations derived from these plants. Extracts of these lyophylized succulents 
      were assayed for phenolic compounds by the Folin Ciocalteau method and compared
      for free radical scavenging capability by the DPPH method. We found that even
      though the Aloe lyophilizate extract contained more phenolic content, the Nopal
      lyophilizate exhibited better free radical scavenging ability. Aloe Vera extract 
      contained 0.278 g/L of phenolic content and exhibited 11.1% free radical
      inhibition, with a free radical scavenging rate constant of 0.177+/-0.015
      min(-1). Nopal Cactus extract contained 0.174 g/L of phenolic content and

      constant of 0.155+/-0.009 min(-1). These results showed Nopal to have greater
      antioxidant potency than Aloe.

TI  - A Review of the Efficacy and Safety of Litramine IQP-G-002AS, an Opuntia
      ficus-indica Derived Fiber for Weight Management.
PG  - 943713
LID - 10.1155/2014/943713 [doi]
AB  - Sedentary lifestyle and caloric overconsumption are the key determinants of the
      escalating obesity prevalence. Reducing dietary fat absorption may help to induce
      a negative energy balance and thus help in managing weight problem. Apart from
      approved drug therapies, weight problems may also be aided with alternative and
      natural treatments. This paper compiled and reviewed the efficacy and safety of
      Litramine IQP-G-002AS, an Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) derived fiber, in reducing
      dietary fat absorption and promoting weight loss. Evidence reviewed shows that
      Litramine IQP-G-002AS displays efficacy in promoting fat excretion and weight
      loss in four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies (including an
      unpublished pilot study). With a daily dosage of 3 g over a seven-day period,
      Litramine IQP-G-002AS showed an increased faecal fat excretion compared with
      placebo (15.8% (SD 5.8%) versus 4.6% (SD 3.1%); P < 0.001). In a 12-week study,
      significant greater weight loss (3.8 kg (SD 1.8 kg) versus 1.4 kg (SD 2.6 kg); P 
      < 0.001) was observed in overweight and obese subjects treated with Litramine
      IQP-G-002AS as compared to placebo. No relevant gastrointestinal side effects
      have been reported for Litramine IQP-G-002AS at the dosages studied.

TI  - Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes as feedstock for ethanol production by
      Kluyveromyces marxianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 3173-83
LID - 10.1007/s11274-014-1745-6 [doi]
AB  - The feasibility of ethanol production using an enzymatic hydrolysate of
      pretreated cladodes of Opuntia ficus-indica (prickly pear cactus) as carbohydrate
      feedstock was investigated, including a comprehensive chemical analysis of the
      cladode biomass and the effects of limited aeration on the fermentation profiles 
      and sugar utilization. The low xylose and negligible mannose content of the
      cladode biomass used in this study suggested that the hemicellulose structure of 
      the O. ficus-indica cladode was atypical of hardwood or softwood hemicelluloses. 
      Separate hydrolysis and fermentation and simultaneous saccharification and
      fermentation procedures using Kluyveromyces marxianus and Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae at 40 and 35 degrees C, respectively, gave similar ethanol yields
      under non-aerated conditions. In oxygen-limited cultures K. marxianus exhibited
      almost double the ethanol productivity compared to non-aerated cultures, although
      after sugar depletion utilization of the produced ethanol was evident. Ethanol
      concentrations of up to 19.5 and 20.6 g l(-1) were obtained with K. marxianus and
      S. cerevisiae, respectively, representing 66 and 70 % of the theoretical yield on
      total sugars in the hydrolysate. Because of the low xylan content of the cladode 
      biomass, a yeast capable of xylose fermentation might not be a prerequisite for
      ethanol production. K. marxianus, therefore, has potential as an alternative to
      S. cerevisiae for bioethanol production. However, the relatively low
      concentration of fermentable sugars in the O. ficus-indica cladode hydrolysate
      presents a technical constraint for commercial exploitation.

TI  - Characterization of volatiles of necrotic Stenocereus thurberi and Opuntia
      littoralis and toxicity and olfactory preference of Drosophila melanogster, D.
      mojavensis wrigleyi, and D. mojavensis sonorensis to necrotic cactus volatiles.
PG  - 1185-92
AB  - Drosophila mojavensis wrigleyi and D. mojavensis sonorensis are geographically
      separated races of cactophilic fruit flies. D. mojavensis sonorensis inhabits the
      Sonoran Desert and utilizes necrotic rots of Stenocereus thurberi Engelm. as a
      food source and to oviposit while D. mojavensis wrigleyi inhabits Santa Catalina 
      Island, California and utilizes the necrotic rots of Opuntia littoralis (Engelm.)
      Cockerell. The objectives of this study were to determine the volatile
      compositions of the necrotic cacti and to determine if the volatile components
      show either selective toxicity or attraction toward the fruit flies. The volatile
      chemical compositions of field-rot specimens of both necrotic cacti were obtained
      by dynamic headspace (purge-and-trap) and hydrodistillation techniques and
      analyzed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. The volatile fraction of
      necrotic S. thurberi early rot was dominated by carboxylic acids (84.8%) and the 
      late rot by p-cresol (32.6% in the dynamic headspace sample and 55.9% in the
      hydrodistilled sample). O. littoralis volatiles were dominated by carboxylic
      acids (86% in the dynamic headspace sample and 89.1% in the hydrodistilled
      sample). Fifteen compounds that were identified in the necrotic rot volatiles
      were used to test insecticidal activity and olfactory preference on the
      cactophilic Drosophila species, as well as D. melanogaster. Differences in
      toxicity and olfactory preference were observed between the different taxa. Both 
      races of D. mojavensis exhibited toxicity to benzaldehyde and 2-nonanone, while
      butanoic acid and palmitic acid were tolerated at high concentrations. D. m.
      wrigleyi demonstrated a greater olfactory preference for anisole, butanoic acid, 
      2-heptanone, and palmitic acid than did D. m. sonorensis, while D. m. sonorensis 
      demonstrated a greater preference for hexadecane, octanoic acid, and oleic acid
      than did D. m. wrigleyi.

TI  - Nopal cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) as a source of bioactive compounds for
      nutrition, health and disease.
PG  - 14879-901
LID - 10.3390/molecules190914879 [doi]
AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica, commonly referred to as prickly pear or nopal cactus, is a 
      dicotyledonous angiosperm plant. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is
      characterized by its remarkable adaptation to arid and semi-arid climates in
      tropical and subtropical regions of the globe. In the last decade, compelling
      evidence for the nutritional and health benefit potential of this cactus has been
      provided by academic scientists and private companies. Notably, its rich
      composition in polyphenols, vitamins, polyunsaturated fatty acids and amino acids
      has been highlighted through the use of a large panel of extraction methods. The 
      identified natural cactus compounds and derivatives were shown to be endowed with
      biologically relevant activities including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,
      hypoglycemic, antimicrobial and neuroprotective properties. The present review is
      aimed at stressing the major classes of cactus components and their medical
      interest through emphasis on some of their biological effects, particularly those
      having the most promising expected health benefit and therapeutic impacts.

TI  - Induction of apoptosis in colon cancer cells treated with isorhamnetin glycosides
      from Opuntia ficus-indica pads.
PG  - 331-6
LID - 10.1007/s11130-014-0438-5 [doi]
AB  - (OFI) contains health-promoting compounds like flavonoids, being the isorhamnetin
      glycosides the most abundant. We evaluated the effect of OFI extracts with
      different isorhamnetin glycosides against two different human colon cancer cells 
      (HT-29 and Caco2). The extracts were obtained by alkaline hydrolysis with NaOH at
      40 degrees C during 15, 30 or 60 min. Tri and diglycosides were the most abundant
      isorhamnetin glycosides, therefore these compounds were isolated to compare their
      cytotoxic effect with the obtained from the extracts. The OFI extracts and
      purified isorhamnetin glycosides were more cytotoxic against HT-29 cells than
      Caco2 cells. OFI-30 exhibited the lowest IC50 value against HT-29 (4.9 +/- 0.5
      mug/mL) and against Caco2 (8.2 +/- 0.3 mug/mL). Isorhamnetin diglycosides IG5 and
      IG6 were more cytotoxic than pure isorhamnetin aglycone or triglycosides when
      they were tested in HT-29 cells. Bioluminescent analysis revealed increased
      activity of caspase 3/7 in OFI extracts-treated cells, particularly for the
      extract with the highest concentration of isorhamnetin triglycosides. Flow
      cytometry analysis confirmed that OFI extract and isorhamnetin glycosides induced
      a higher percentage of apoptosis in HT-29 than in Caco2, while isorhamnetin was
      more apoptotic in Caco2. This research demonstrated that glycosilation affected
      antiproliferative effect of pure isorhamnetin glycosides or when they are mixed
      with other phytochemicals in an extract obtained from OFI.

AB  - Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are highly conserved proteins, shown to protect
      organisms against physical and physiological stress. TEX-OE((R)) is a patented
      total extract of the fruit of Opuntia ficus indica, which has been demonstrated
      to accelerate the development of HSPs in several animal species. One-day-old
      commercial broiler chicks were treated with TEX-OE((R)); HSP was measured by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and a large commercial field trial
      investigated key performance indicators (KPIs) in treated versus untreated
      controls chicks. TEX-OE((R)) significantly increased HSP concentrations in
      treated chicks versus controls. Final cumulative mortality, liveweight and
      percentage factory-rejects were better than in controls. The accelerated HSP
      response may enable chicks to cope with early stressors, which is reflected in
      improved KPIs.

TI  - Pro-oxidant activity of indicaxanthin from Opuntia ficus indica modulates
      arachidonate metabolism and prostaglandin synthesis through lipid peroxide
      production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages.
PG  - 892-900
LID - 10.1016/j.redox.2014.07.004 [doi]
AB  - Macrophages come across active prostaglandin (PG) metabolism during inflammation,
      shunting early production of pro-inflammatory towards anti-inflammatory mediators
      terminating the process. This work for the first time provides evidence that a
      phytochemical may modulate the arachidonate (AA) metabolism in lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, promoting the ultimate formation of
      anti-inflammatory cyclopentenone 15deoxy-PGJ2. Added 1 h before LPS,
      indicaxanthin from Opuntia Ficus Indica prevented activation of nuclear
      factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and over-expression of PGE2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1), but
      up-regulated cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and PGD2 synthase (H-PGDS), with final
      production of the anti-inflammatory cyclopentenone. The effects were positively
      related with concentration between 50 and 100 microM. Indicaxanthin did not have 
      any effect in the absence of LPS. A kinetic study investigating the redox status 
      of LPS-stimulated macrophages between 0.5 and 12 h, either in the absence or in
      the presence of 50-100 microM indicaxanthin, revealed a differential control of
      ROS production, with early (0.5-3 h) modest inhibition, followed by a progressive
      (3-12 h) concentration-dependent enhancement over the level induced by LPS alone.
      In addition, indicaxanthin caused early (0.5-3 h) concentration-dependent
      elevation of conjugated diene lipid hydroperoxides, and production of
      hydroxynonenal-protein adducts, over the amount induced by LPS. In LPS-stimulated
      macrophages indicaxanthin did not affect PG metabolism when co-incubated with
      either an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase or vitamin E. It is concluded that
      LPS-induced pro-oxidant activity of indicaxanthin at the membrane level allows
      formation of signaling intermediates whose accumulation modulates PG biosynthetic
      pathway in inflamed macrophages.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trough collections of plants and interviews with 110 individuals, an 
      ethnobotanical study was conducted in order to determine the knowledge and use
      plant species in Rayones, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. The aim of this study was to record
      all useful plants and their uses, to know whether differences exist in the
      knowledge about the number of species and uses between women and men, and to know
      if there is a correlation between the age of individuals and knowledge of species
      and their uses. METHODS: A total of 110 persons were interviewed (56 men, 56
      women). Semistructured interviews were carried out. The data were analyzed by
      means of Student t test and the Pearson Correlation Coeficient. RESULTS: A total 
      of 252 species, 228 genera and 91 families of vascular plants were recorded.
      Astraceae, Fabaceae and are the most important families with useful species and
      Agave and Opuntia are the genera with the highest number of useful species. One
      hundred and thirty six species are considered as medicinal. Agave, Acacia and
      Citrus are the genera with the highest number of medicinal species. Other uses
      includes edible, spiritual rituals, construction and ornamentals. There was a
      non-significant correlation between the person's age and number of species, but a
      significant very low negative correlation between the person's age and number of 
      uses was found. CONCLUSIONS: Knowing their medicinal uses is an important issue
      for the people of Rayones. Boiling and preparing infusions are the main ways of
      using plants by residents. The leaves, the branches, and the fruits are the most 
      commonly used parts. Almost 18% of the flora is used for wood and construction
      purposes. Several uses such as cosmetic, shampoo, firming skin tonics and health 
      hair products recorded in Rayones has not been reported for other areas in the
      state of Nuevo Leon. In Rayones, women have a greater knowledge about plants and 
      their uses than men, particularly, medicinal plants, but, men have a greater
      knowledge about wood and construction species.

TI  - Betanin--a food colorant with biological activity.
PG  - 36-47
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201400484 [doi]
AB  - Betalains are water-soluble nitrogen-containing pigments that are subdivided in
      red-violet betacyanins and yellow-orange betaxanthins. Due to glycosylation and
      acylation betalains exhibit a huge structural diversity. Betanin
      (betanidin-5-O-beta-glucoside) is the most common betacyanin in the plant
      kingdom. According to the regulation on food additives betanin is permitted
      quantum satis as a natural red food colorant (E162). Moreover, betanin is used as
      colorant in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Recently, potential health benefits of
      betalains and betalain-rich foods (e.g. red beet, Opuntia sp.) have been
      discussed. Betanin is a scavenger of reactive oxygen species and exhibits
      gene-regulatory activity partly via nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like
      2-(Nrf2) dependent signaling pathways. Betanin may induce phase II enzymes and
      antioxidant defense mechanisms. Furthermore, betanin possibly prevents LDL
      oxidation and DNA damage. Potential blood pressure lowering effects of red beet
      seem to be mainly mediated by dietary nitrate rather than by betanin per se.

TI  - The effect of nopal (Opuntia ficus indica) on postprandial blood glucose,
      incretins, and antioxidant activity in Mexican patients with type 2 diabetes
      after consumption of two different composition breakfasts.

AB  - Nopal is a plant used in traditional Mexican medicine to treat diabetes. However,
      there is insufficient scientific evidence to demonstrate whether nopal can
      regulate postprandial glucose. The purpose for conducting this study was to
      evaluate the glycemic index, insulinemic index, glucose-dependent insulinotropic 
      peptide (GIP) index, and the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) index, and the
      effect of nopal on patients with type 2 diabetes after consumption of a
      high-carbohydrate breakfast (HCB) or high-soy-protein breakfast (HSPB) on the
      postprandial response of glucose, insulin, GIP, GLP-1, and antioxidant activity. 
      In study 1, the glycemic index, insulinemic index, GIP index, and GLP-1 index
      were calculated for seven healthy participants who consumed 50 g of available
      carbohydrates from glucose or dehydrated nopal. In study 2, 14 patients with type
      2 diabetes consumed nopal in HCB or HSPB with or without 300 g steamed nopal. The
      glycemic index of nopal was 32.5+/-4, insulinemic index was 36.1+/-6, GIP index
      was 6.5+/-3.0, and GLP-1 index was 25.9+/-18. For those patients with type 2
      diabetes who consumed the HCB+nopal, there was significantly lower area under the
      curve for glucose (287+/-30) than for those who consumed the HCB only (443+/-49),
      and lower incremental area under the curve for insulin (5,952+/-833 vs
      7,313+/-1,090), and those patients with type 2 diabetes who consumed the HSPB
      avoided postprandial blood glucose peaks. Consumption of the HSPB+nopal
      significantly reduced the postprandial peaks of GIP concentration at 30 and 45
      minutes and increased the antioxidant activity after 2 hours measured by the
      2,2-diphenyl-1-picrilhidracyl method. These findings suggest that nopal could
      reduce postprandial blood glucose, serum insulin, and plasma GIP peaks, as well
      as increase antioxidant activity in healthy people and patients with type 2
      diabetes.

TI  - Accumulation of silicon in cacti native to the United States: characterization of
      silica bodies and cyclic oligosiloxanes in Stenocereus thurberi, Opuntia
      littoralis, Opuntia ficus-indica, and Opuntia stricta.
PG  - 873-8
AB  - Four different cactus species growing in the United States, Stenocereus thurberi 
      growing in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Arizona, Opuntia littoralis and
      Opuntia ficus-indica, growing on Santa Catalina Island, California, and Opuntia
      stricta, growing in northern Alabama, were examined for the presence of silica
      bodies (opaline phytoliths). Silica bodies were found in all four of these cactus
      species, parallelepiped-shaped crystals in S. thurberi, and starburst-shaped
      crystalline structures in the three Opuntia species. In addition, the essential
      oils of the four cactus species were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed
      by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. To our surprise, S. thurberi, O.
      littoralis, and O. ficus-indica (but not O. stricta) essential oils contained
      cyclic oligosiloxanes. To our knowledge, cyclic oligosiloxanes have not been
      previously found as essential oil components.

TI  - Betalain profile, phenolic content, and color characterization of different parts
      and varieties of Opuntia ficus-indica.
PG  - 8491-9
LID - 10.1021/jf502465g [doi]
AB  - Three different varieties of Opuntia ficus-indica (R, red; Y, yellow; RY,
      red-yellow) have been considered in this study. Attention was focused on
      differential tristimulus colorimetry and on the analysis of individual betalains 
      (HPLC-DAD-ESI-ToF-MS) and phenolic content, scarcely previously reported in these
      kinds of samples. The importance of this research stems from the elucidation of
      the parts and varieties of cactus pear more optimal for use as natural colorants 
      and sources of phenolics and betalains. Thus, the RY pulp was appropriate to
      obtain colorants with high color intensity (C*(ab) = 66.5), whereas the whole Y
      fruit and R pulp reached powerful and stable yellow and red colors, respectively 
      (C*(ab)/h(ab), 57.1/84.7 and 61.1 degrees /81.8 degrees ). This choice was also
      based on the visually appreciable differences (DeltaE*(ab) > 5) among samples,
      mainly quantitative (%Delta(2)L, %Delta(2)C). In addition, seeds of all Opuntia
      varieties showed significantly (p < 0.05) similar phenolic content (around 23.3
      mg/g) and color characteristics.

TI  - The importance of the one carbon cycle nutritional support in human male
      fertility: a preliminary clinical report.
PG  - 71
LID - 10.1186/1477-7827-12-71 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sperm chromatin structure is often impaired; mainly due to oxidative 
      damage. Antioxidant treatments do not consistently produce fertility improvements
      and, when given at high doses, they might block essential oxidative processes
      such as chromatin compaction. This study was intended to assess the effect on
      male sub-fertility of a pure one carbon cycle nutritional support without strong 
      antioxidants. METHODS: Male partners of couples resistant to at least 2 assisted 
      reproductive technology (ART) attempts, with no evidence of organic causes of
      infertility and with either DNA fragmentation index (DFI) measured by Terminal
      deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) or nuclear
      decondensation index (SDI) measured by aniline blue staining exceeding 20%, were 
      invited to take part in a trial of a nutritional support in preparation for a
      further ART attempt. The treatment consisted of a combination of B vitamins,
      zinc, a proprietary opuntia fig extract and small amounts of N-acetyl-cysteine
      and Vitamin E (Condensyl), all effectors of the one carbon cycle. RESULTS: 84
      patients were enrolled, they took 1 or 2 Condensyl tablets per day for 2 to 12
      months. Positive response rates were 64.3% for SDI, 71.4% for DFI and 47.6% for
      both SDI and DFI. Eighteen couples (21%) experienced a spontaneous pregnancy
      before the planned ART cycle, all ended with a live birth. The remaining 66
      couples underwent a new ART attempt (4 IUI; 18 IVF; 44 ICSI) resulting in 22
      further clinical pregnancies and 15 live births. The clinical pregnancy rate
      (CPR) and the live birth rate (LBR) were 47.6% and 39.3% respectively. The full
      responders, i.e. the 40 patients achieving an improvement of both SDI and DFI,
      reported a CPR of 70% and a LBR of 57.5% (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional
      support of the one carbon cycle without strong antioxidants improves both the SDI
      and the DFI in ART resistant male partners and results in high pregnancy rates
      suggesting a positive effect on their fertility potential.

TI  - Effects of cactus fiber on the excretion of dietary fat in healthy subjects: a
      double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical investigation.
PG  - 39-44
LID - 10.1016/j.curtheres.2014.02.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) fiber was shown to promote weight loss 
      in a 3-month clinical investigation. As demonstrated by in vitro studies, cactus 
      fiber binds to dietary fat and its use results in reduced absorption, which in
      turn leads to reduced energy absorption and ultimately the reduction of body
      weight. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to elucidate the dietary fat
      binding capacity of cactus fiber through determination of fecal fat excretion in 
      healthy volunteers. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This clinical investigation was
      performed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in
      healthy subjects for a period of approximately 45 days. Twenty healthy volunteer 
      subjects were randomized to receive cactus fiber or placebo, 2 tablets thrice
      daily with main meals. All subjects were provided with meals during the study
      period (except washout) according to a standardized meal plan, with 35% of daily 
      energy need coming from fat. Two 24-hour feces samples were collected during both
      the baseline and treatment periods for analysis of the fat content. RESULTS:
      Cactus fiber showed an increased fecal fat excretion compared with placebo (mean 
      [SD] = 15.79% [5.79%] vs 4.56% [3.09%]; P < 0.001). No adverse events were
      reported throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Cactus fiber has been shown to
      significantly promote fecal fat excretion in healthy adults. The results of our
      study support the hypothesis that cactus fiber helps in reducing body weight by
      binding to dietary fat and increasing its excretion, thus reducing dietary fat
      available for absorption. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01590667.

TI  - Simple and robust monitoring of ethanol fermentations by capillary
      electrophoresis.
PG  - 329-42
LID - 10.1002/bab.1269 [doi]
AB  - Free-solution capillary electrophoresis (CE), or capillary zone electrophoresis, 
      with direct UV detection was used for the first time for the determination of
      mono- and disaccharides, sugar alcohols, and ethanol in fermentation broths.
      Sample preparation proved to be minimal: no derivatization or specific sample
      purification was needed. The CE conditions can be adapted to the type of
      fermentation by simply altering the background electrolyte (BGE). KOH (130 mM) or
      NaOH (130 mM) as the BGE led to the fastest analysis time when monitoring simple 
      fermentations. A mixture of 65 mM NaOH and 65 mM LiOH led to a 19% improvement in
      resolution for a complex mixture of carbohydrates. Quantification of a simple
      carbohydrate fermentation by CE showed values in close agreement with that of
      high-performance anion exchange chromatography and high-performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) on a cation exchange resin. For complex fermentations,
      quantification of carbohydrates by HPLC and CE led to similar results, whereas CE
      requires an injection volume of only 10-20 nL. Analysis of an ethanol
      fermentation of hydrolyzed plant fiber demonstrated the robustness of the
      separation and detection of carbohydrates, as well as ethanol. Ethanol
      determination is achieved by coupling the CE method to pressure mobilization,
      using the same instrument and the same sample.

TI  - The matrix alters the role of path redundancy on patch colonization rates.
PG  - 1444-50
AB  - Landscape connectivity is central to many problems in ecology and conservation.
      Recently, the role of path redundancies on movement of organisms has been
      emphasized for understanding connectivity, because increasing the number of
      potential paths (i.e., redundancy) is predicted to increase movement rates, which
      can alter predictions for foraging theory and population dynamics. Nonetheless,
      experiments that test for the effects of path redundancies on connectivity remain
      scarce. We tested for the role of path redundancies on the movements of a habitat
      specialist, Chelinidea vittiger, using experimental arenas that altered path
      redundancy by varying the amount and configuration of stepping stones across a
      gradient of matrix resistance. We found that stepping-stone redundancies
      increased colonization rates to target patches, but the effects differed
      depending on the configuration of redundancy and the structure of the matrix. In 
      addition, matrix effects were better explained through the use of effective
      distance measures that incorporate redundancy in the matrix than those that
      ignore redundancy. Our results provide experimental evidence that measures that
      ignore redundancies may be inadequate for capturing functional connectivity,
      illustrate the ways in which redundancies alter colonization rates, and emphasize
      how habitat configuration and matrix structure can interact to guide movement of 
      individuals across landscapes.

LID - 10.3109/13880209.2014.890230 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill. (Cactaceae)) is a medicinal
      plant widely used to treat diabetes. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the
      hypoglycemic and antihyperglycemic effect of cactus pear seed oil (CPSO), its
      mechanism of action, and any toxic effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      hypoglycemic effect of CPSO was evaluated in groups of six healthy Wistar rats
      given 1 or 2 ml kg(-1) orally and compared with groups receiving glibenclamide (2
      mg kg(-1)) or water. Glycemia was determined after 30, 60, 120, 240, and 360 min.
      The antihyperglycemic effect of CPSO was determined in healthy rats and in
      streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ); normal rats received 0.8 ml kg(-1)
      CPSO, while diabetic rats received 1 ml kg(-1) CPSO, their controls received
      water or 2 mg kg(-1) glibenclamide. For the antihyperglycemic effect evaluation, 
      all the animals were fasted for 16 h before treatment and received glucose orally
      at 1 g kg(-1) 30 min after treatment; blood was taken after 30, 90, 150, and 210 
      min. Intestinal glucose absorption was estimated in rat jejunum perfused with a
      solution containing 5.55 mmol l(-1) glucose. Acute toxicity was determined in
      albino mice that received oral or intraperitoneal doses of 1, 3, or 5 ml kg(-1)
      CPSO. RESULTS: CPSO (p.o.) decreased postprandial hyperglycemia (60 min after
      glucose loading), 40.33% and 16.01%, in healthy and STZ-diabetic glucose-loaded
      rats, respectively. CPSO, also, significantly decreased intestinal glucose
      absorption by 25.42%. No adverse effects were seen in mice administered CPSO at
      up to 5 ml kg(-1). CONCLUSION: CPSO is antihyperglycemic. The effect can be
      explained partly by inhibition of intestinal glucose absorption.

AB  - Nutrition is a major constraint in smallholder livestock production; hence, the
      use of alternative sources which are adaptive to long dry seasons is imperative. 
      The study was conducted to establish options of improving nutrition and
      palatability and also to determine the performance of goats fed on cactus-browse 
      hay as dry season supplements. Palatability and adequacy of nutrition was
      investigated using 32 castrated male goat kids. The kids were housed in
      individual metabolism cages for 84 days in a complete randomised design (CRD)
      with eight replicates for the four treatment diets. Daily experimental diet,
      basal diet and water intake were measured, and live mass was measured at weekly
      intervals. Daily diet intake was significantly different (P < 0.05) among
      treatments. Kids that were supplemented with cactus-Leucaena leucocephala meal
      (CLLM) consumed more than those on cactus-Acacia angustissima meal (CAAM),
      cactus-Gliricidia sepium meal (CGSM) and cactus-Pennisetum purpureum meal (CPPM) 
      in that order. CGSM was not readily palatable as goat kids refused to take it
      when mixed with fresh cactus. Animals that were not supplemented with a source of
      nitrogen together with those that were supplemented with less palatable diet of
      CGSM lost weight significantly (P < 0.05) initially but gained weight slightly
      towards the end of the study. Significantly higher weight gains (P < 0.05) were
      observed in animals in CLLM and CAAM treatment. It was concluded that fresh
      cactus could be used to improve poor quality roughage intakes in goats, and
      therefore, there is need to promote its use in periods of feed deficit especially
      in smallholder sector.

PG  - 2129-36
LID - 10.1039/c4fo00456f [doi]
AB  - The genus Opuntia (Cactaceae) includes different plants well adapted to arid and 
      semi-arid zones. These species are cultivated under restricted growth conditions,
      not suitable for the growth of other fruits/vegetables. The cactus pear is a
      well-known example inside Opuntia genus. Its young cladodes, also known as
      nopalitos, are frequently consumed and used in folk medicine due to their
      beneficial effects and phytochemical composition. Herein, hydrophilic and
      lipophilic extracts from cladodes of Opuntia microdasys and Opuntia macrorhiza
      were characterized. Furthermore, their antioxidant properties were compared to
      the corresponding phytochemical profile. Despite the phylogenetic proximity and
      similar geographical origin O. microdasys and O. macrorhiza showed significant
      differences in sugars, organic acids, phenolic compounds, fatty acids and
      tocopherols profiles. In particular, O. microdasys distinguished for having high 
      contents in fructose, glucose, C6:0, C8:0, C12:0, C14:0, C14:1, C16:0, C18:3,
      C20:0, C22:0, C23:0, C24:0, SFA and tocopherols, and also for its higher DPPH
      EC50 values. O. microdasys by its side proved to have significantly higher
      amounts of trehalose, organic acids, C13:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:0, C18:1, C20:1,
      C20:2 and MUFA. The obtained phytochemical profiles might be considered as useful
      information to select the best Opuntia species regarding a determined application
      of its natural extracts/isolated compounds.

TI  - Biosorption of hexavalent chromium from aqueous medium with Opuntia biomass.
PG  - 670249
LID - 10.1155/2014/670249 [doi]
AB  - The biosorption of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solutions by Opuntia cladodes
      and ectodermis from cactus fruits was investigated. Both types of biomass are
      considered low-cost, natural, and ecofriendly biosorbents. Batch experiments were
      carried out to determine Cr(VI) biosorption capacity and the efficiency of the
      biosorption process under different pH, initial Cr(VI) concentration, and sorbent
      dosage. The biosorption of Cr(VI) by Opuntia biomass was highly pH dependent,
      favoring higher metal uptake at low pH. The higher biosorption capacity was
      exhibited at pH 2. The optimal conditions were obtained at a sorbent dosage of 1 
      g L(-1) and initial metal concentration of 10 mg L(-1). Biosorption kinetic data 
      were properly fitted with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The rate
      constant, the initial biosorption rate, and the equilibrium biosorption capacity 
      were determined. The experimental equilibrium data obtained were analyzed using
      two-parameter isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin). The Langmuir
      maximum monolayer biosorption capacity (q max) was 18.5 mg g(-1) for cladodes and
      16.4 mg g(-1) for ectodermis. The results suggest that Opuntia biomass could be
      considered a promising low-cost biosorbent for the ecofriendly removal of Cr(VI) 
      from aqueous systems.

TI  - Reactive oxygen species generated by a heat shock protein (Hsp) inducing product 
      contributes to Hsp70 production and Hsp70-mediated protective immunity in Artemia
      franciscana against pathogenic vibrios.

AB  - The cytoprotective role of heat shock protein (Hsp70) described in a variety of
      animal disease models, including vibriosis in farmed aquatic animals, suggests
      that new protective strategies relying upon the use of compounds that selectively
      turn on Hsp genes could be developed. The product Tex-OE(R) (hereafter referred
      to as Hspi), an extract from the skin of the prickly pear fruit, Opuntia ficus
      indica, was previously shown to trigger Hsp70 synthesis in a non-stressful
      situation in a variety of animals, including in a gnotobiotically (germ-free)
      cultured brine shrimp Artemia franciscana model system. This model system offers 
      great potential for carrying out high-throughput, live-animal screens of
      compounds that have health benefit effects. By using this model system, we aimed 
      to disclose the underlying cause behind the induction of Hsp70 by Hspi in the
      shrimp host, and to determine whether the product affects the shrimp in inducing 
      resistance towards pathogenic vibrios. We provide unequivocal evidences
      indicating that during the pretreatment period with Hspi, there is an initial
      release of reactive oxygen species (hydrogen peroxide and/or superoxide anion),
      generated by the added product, in the rearing water and associated with the
      host. The reactive molecules generated are the triggering factors responsible for
      causing Hsp70 induction within Artemia. We have also shown that Hspi acts
      prophylactically at an optimum dose regimen to confer protection against
      pathogenic vibrios. This salutary effect was associated with upregulation of two 
      important immune genes, prophenoloxidase and transglutaminase of the innate
      immune system. These findings suggest that inducers of stress protein (e.g.
      Hsp70) are potentially important modulator of immune responses and might be
      exploited to confer protection to cultured shrimp against Vibrio infection.

AB  - Phytochemicals may exert chemo-preventive effects on cells of the
      gastro-intestinal tract by modulating epigenome-regulated gene expression. The
      effect of the aqueous extract from the edible fruit of Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI 
      extract), and of its betalain pigment indicaxanthin (Ind), on proliferation of
      human colon cancer Caco-2 cells has been investigated. Whole extract and Ind
      caused a dose-dependent apoptosis of proliferating cells at nutritionally
      relevant amounts, with IC50 400+/-25 mg fresh pulp equivalents/mL, and 115+/-15
      muM (n=9), respectively, without toxicity for post-confluent differentiated
      cells. Ind accounted for approximately 80% of the effect of the whole extract.
      Ind did not cause oxidative stress in proliferating Caco-2 cells. Epigenomic
      activity of Ind was evident as de-methylation of the tumor suppressor p16(INK4a) 
      gene promoter, reactivation of the silenced mRNA expression and accumulation of
      p16(INK4a), a major controller of cell cycle. As a consequence, decrease of
      hyper-phosphorylated, in favor of the hypo-phosphorylated retinoblastoma was
      observed, with unaltered level of the cycline-dependent kinase CDK4. Cell cycle
      showed arrest in the G2/M-phase. Dietary cactus pear fruit and Ind may have
      chemo-preventive potential in intestinal cells.

TI  - Enhancing safety and shelf life of fresh-cut mango by application of edible
      coatings and microencapsulation technique.
PG  - 210-7
LID - 10.1002/fsn3.98 [doi]
AB  - Mango pulp is very perishable and so has a short shelf life, which both marketers
      and consumers would like to be longer. Manually sliced mango was treated by
      coating opuntia mucilage-rosemary oil (Mu + RO), 2 g rosemary oil microencapsul
      (ROM), and 2 g (ROM) plus (Mu + RO); the treated mango pieces were placed in
      plastic trays, and overwrapped with PVDC film and then stored at 6 degrees C.
      Changes in the quality parameters and activity of peroxidase (POD) enzyme were
      evaluated for 9 days of storage period. These treatments retarded loss of
      ascorbic acid and the drop in sensory acceptability, fewer changes in color,
      decreasing activity POD enzyme. These also inhibited the decay incidence and
      slowed microbial growth. The (Mu + RO) treatment was more effective in
      controlling postharvest quality as compared to the (ROM) treatment, but the data 
      reveal that applying the compound treatment effectively prolongs the quality
      attributes and extends the storage life of sliced mango fruit.

      extracts synergistically attenuates menopausal symptoms in estrogen-deficient
      rats.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Prickly pear cactus grown in Korea (Opuntia
      ficus-indica Mill, KC) and Buchema (Dioscorea nipponica Makino, B) have been
      traditionally used in East Asia and South America to treat various metabolic
      diseases. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the extracts of
      KC, B, and KC+B can prevent the impairments of energy, glucose, lipid and bone
      homeostasis in estrogen-deficient ovariectomized (OVX) rats and to explore their 
      mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OVX rats were divided into 4 groups and fed
      high fat diets supplemented with either 3% dextrin (control), 3% KC, 3% B or 1.5%
      KC+1.5% B. Sham rats were fed 3% dextrin. After 12 weeks of diet consumption,
      energy, lipid, glucose and bone metabolisms were analyzed and Wnt signaling in
      the femur and hepatic signaling were determined. RESULTS: OVX impaired energy,
      glucose and lipid metabolism and decreased uterine and bone masses. B and KC+B
      prevented the decrease in energy expenditure, especially from fat oxidation, in
      OVX rats, but did not affect food intake. KC+B and B reduced body weight and
      visceral fat levels, as compared to the OVX-control, by decreasing fat synthesis 
      and inhibiting FAS and SREBP-1c expression. KC+B and B prevented the increases in
      serum lipid levels and insulin resistance by improving hepatic insulin signaling 
      (pIRS-->pAkt-->pGSK-3beta). KC and KC+B also prevented decreases in bone mineral 
      density (BMD) in the femur and lumbar spine in OVX rats. This was related to
      decreased expressions of bone turnover markers such as serum osteocalcin,
      alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone-specific ALP levels, and increased serum P
      levels. KC and KC+B upregulated low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 
      5 and beta-catenin in OVX rats, but suppressed the expression of dickkopf-related
      protein 1. B alone improved energy, lipid and glucose homeostasis, but not bone
      loss, whereas KC alone enhanced BMD, but not energy, lipid or glucose
      homeostasis. CONCLUSION: KC+B synergistically attenuated impairments of bone,
      energy, lipid and glucose metabolism by OVX, suggesting potential efficacy of the
      combination for alleviating menopausal symptoms.

TI  - Replacement of wheat bran with spineless cactus (Opuntia ficus indica Mill cv
      Gigante) and urea in the diets of Holstein x Gyr heifers.
PG  - 1149-54
LID - 10.1007/s11250-014-0619-0 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the replacement effect of wheat bran with
      spineless cactus and urea in heifers. Twenty-four heifers with an average initial
      weight of 185 +/- 13 kg were used in this experiment. Four levels of spineless
      cactus corrected with urea and ammonium sulfate (9:1) were studied: 0, 33, 66,
      and 100 % replacement with wheat bran. Samples of feed, orts, and feces were
      analyzed to estimate the intake and digestibility of dry matter (DM) and
      nutrients. Indigestible neutral detergent fiber was used as an internal marker.
      The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design. Dry matter,
      neutral detergent fiber, and total digestible nutrient intake demonstrated a
      quadratic effect (P < 0.05). Rumen degradable protein intake increased linearly
      (P < 0.05). The maximum DM digestibility was estimated to be 0.67 with a 43 %
      replacement. Crude protein and NDF digestibility increased linearly (P < 0.05).
      The total body weight gain and average daily gain decreased linearly with the
      replacement. Thus, it is practical to replace wheat bran with spineless cactus
      containing urea and ammonium sulfate up to 66 % in sugar cane-based diets.

AB  - The antioxidant properties, some phytochemicals and nutritionals were
      characterized in two prickly pear cactus (Opuntia ficus indica Mill.) cultivars; 
      red and yellow; growing in Taif, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The antioxidant
      properties of red cactus cultivar were higher than the yellow cactus cultivar.
      Linear correlation appeared between the antioxidant properties and total
      phenolics. All samples nearly have the same quantity of iron, copper, sodium and 
      potassium. Some phenolic compounds were detected by HPLC-UV analysis. HPLC-RI
      analysis of all samples revealed the absence of sucrose and the presence of
      glucose and fructose. According to the above results, this study gave a good
      indication about the nutritional and pharmaceutical potential of the two cactus
      cultivars that must be widespread cultivated in arid and semiarid regions as KSA 
      accompanying with establishment of industries beside the cactus farms that used
      all parts of plants.

AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate the activity of the coagulant extracted
      from the cactus Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) in the process of
      coagulation/flocculation of textile effluents. Preliminary tests of a kaolinite
      suspension achieved maximum turbidity removal of 95 % using an NaCl extraction
      solution. Optimization assays were conducted with actual effluents using the
      response surface methodology (RSM) based on the Box-Behnken experimental design. 
      The responses of the variables FeCl3, dosage, cactus dosage, and pH in the
      removal of COD and turbidity from both effluents were investigated. The optimum
      conditions determined for jeans washing laundry effluent were the following:
      FeCl3 160 mg L(-1), cactus dosage 2.60 mg L(-1), and pH 5.0. For the fabric
      dyeing effluent, the optimum conditions were the following: FeCl3 640 mg L(-1),
      cactus dosage 160 mg L(-1), and pH 6.0. Investigation of the effects of the
      storage time and temperature of the cactus O. ficus-indica showed that
      coagulation efficiency was not significantly affected for storage at room
      temperature for up to 4 days.

AB  - Cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) is a xerophyte plant that belongs to the Cactaceae 
      family. The present study was designed to investigate the possible protective
      effects of cactus cladodes extract (CCE) on sodium dichromate-induced testis
      damage in adult male Wistar rats. For this purpose, CCE at a dose of 100 mg/kg
      was orally administrated, followed by 10 mg/kg sodium dichromate (intraperitoneal
      injection). After 40 days of treatment, the rats were sacrificed, and the testes 
      were excised for histological, lipid peroxidation (LPO), and antioxidant enzyme
      analyses. Sodium dichromate treatment significantly (P<0.01) decreased the body, 
      testis, and accessory sex organ weights, sperm count and motility, and serum
      testosterone level. In addition, histological analysis revealed pronounced
      morphological alterations with tubular necrosis and reduction in the number of
      gametes in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules of sodium dichromate-intoxicated
      rats. Furthermore, exposure to sodium dichromate significantly (P<0.01) increased
      LPO level and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and
      glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities in testis. Interestingly, pretreatment
      with CCE significantly (P<0.01) restored the serum testosterone level, sperm
      count, and motility to the levels of the control group. Moreover, CCE
      administration was capable of reducing the elevated level of LPO and
      significantly (P<0.01) increased SOD, CAT, and GPx activities in testis. Cactus

AB  - Pulp (CP) and ultrafiltered (UF) cactus pear extracts were encapsulated with
      Capsul (C) by applying a central composite design (CP-C and UF-C systems) by
      spray-drying. To evaluate the effect of the extract, microparticles obtained
      under optimal conditions were characterised and stored at 60 degrees C.
      Betacyanin and betaxanthin encapsulation efficiency reached values above 98% for 
      both systems studied. This efficiency was attributed to strong interactions
      between betalains and the polymer. Betalain degradation in CP-C and UF-C
      microparticles followed pseudo-first order kinetics. The betacyanin degradation
      rate constant was significantly higher for CP-C than for UF-C. These results
      suggested that the mucilage or higher sugar content of CP increased the
      hygroscopicity of the CP-C microparticles, leading to the degradation of
      betalain. The hydrolysis pathway was the main mechanism of betanin degradation
      during microparticle storage. These results demonstrate the potential utility of 
      both CP-C and UF-C microparticles as natural colourants for healthy foods.

PG  - 2094-9
LID - 10.1099/ijs.0.060400-0 [doi]
AB  - A novel high G+C actinobacterium, designated strain OS1-21(T), was isolated from 
      the rhizosphere soil of a cactus (Opuntia fiscus-indica var. sanboten) and the
      taxonomic status was investigated using a polyphasic approach. Cells of strain
      OS1-21(T) were aerobic, Gram-stain-positive, non-endospore-forming, non-motile
      rods; colonies of the cells were circular, translucent, smooth and moderate
      yellow in colour. LL-Diaminopimelic acid was the diagnostic diamino acid in
      cell-wall peptidoglycan. The predominant menaquinone was MK-8(H4). The major
      fatty acids were iso-C(16 : 0), iso-C(16 : 0) 2-OH, 10-methyl C(17 : 0),
      10-methyl C(18 : 0) and C(17 : 1)cis9. The polar lipids contained
      diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and two
      unknown phospholipids. The DNA G+C content was 73.7 mol%. Based on 16S rRNA gene 
      sequence analysis, the closest phylogenetic neighbours were Nocardioides
      panacihumi Gsoil 616(T) (98.7% sequence similarity) and Nocardioides terrae
      VA15(T) (97.8%), followed by Nocardioides marinus CL-DD14(T) (97.1%). DNA-DNA
      relatedness values of strain OS1-21(T) with the type strains of the closest
      phylogenetic neighbours were low (<16.0%). Combined data of polyphasic taxonomic 
      analyses revealed that the organism could be assigned to a novel species of the
      genus Nocardioides, for which the name Nocardioides opuntiae sp. nov. is
      proposed. The type strain is OS1-21(T) ( = KCTC 19804(T) = NBRC 107915(T)).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the ocular and extra-ocular features, clinical presentation,
      and treatment of prickly pear glochids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective
      study included 23 eyes of 21 patients with ocular prickly pear spines who were
      seen between August and October 2011 in the outpatient ophthalmic clinic at
      Prince Rashid Bin Al Hassan military hospital in Jordan. Medical records of
      patients including age, gender, history of exposure to prickly pear plants, and
      ocular examination were reviewed. All glochids were localized and removed with
      forceps under topical anesthesia with the patient at the slit lamp. Patients were
      followed up after one week. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 37.1 years with
      a male to female ratio of 1.6: 1. Involvement of the right eye was seen in 61.9% 
      patients, left eye in 28.6% patients, and bilateral involvement in 9.5% patients.
      Glochids were most commonly found in the upper subtarsal conjunctival space
      (47.6%) followed by inferior palpebral conjunctiva in 23.8% eyes. The most common
      complaint was eye irritation in 95.2% patients. Pain was a complaint in 57.1%
      patients. Superior corneal epithelial erosions or ulcer were found in 33.3%
      patients, inferior corneal epithelial erosions in 19.1% patients, and diffuse
      epithelial erosions in 9.5% patients. Glochids were found in other parts of the
      body in 38.1% patients. CONCLUSION: Although prickly pear glochid ocular surface 
      injury is not uncommon in the region during summer, it should be considered in
      patient with eye pain during that period. Farmers who are in close contact with
      prickly pears should use protective eyeglasses and gloves.

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica f. inermis (cactus pear) flowers have wide application in
      folk medicine. However, there are few reports focusing on their biological
      activity and were no reports on their chemical composition. The nutrient
      composition and hexane extracts of Opuntia flowers at 4 flowering stages and
      their antibacterial and antifungal activities were investigated. The chemical
      composition showed considerable amounts of fiber, protein, and minerals.
      Potassium (K) was the predominant mineral followed by calcium (Ca), magnesium
      (Mg), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn). The main compounds in the various
      hexane extracts were 9.12-octadecadienoic acid (29-44%) and hexadecanoic acid
      (8.6-32%). The antibacterial activity tests showed that O. inermis hexane
      extracts have high effectiveness against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
      aureus, making this botanical source a potential contender as a food preservative
      or food control additive.

AB  - The antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of some cultivars of the nopal
      cactus have not been determined. In this study, 8 cultivars of nopal cacti from
      Mexico were assayed for phenolic content, antioxidant activities, and
      antimicrobial activities against Campylobacter Jejuni, Vibrio cholera, and
      Clostridium Perfringens. Plant material was washed, dried, and macerated in
      methanol. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined using the
      broth microdilution method. Antioxidant activities were quantitatively determined
      using spectrophotometric methods. The MCBs of the nopal cacti ranged from 1.1 to 
      12.5 mg/mL for c. jejuni, 4.4 to 30 mg/mL for V. cholera, and 0.8 to 16 mg/mL for
      C. perfringens in the cultivars Cardon Blanco, Real de Catorce, and Jalpa,
      respectively. High quantities of total phenols and total flavonoids were found in
      the Jalpa cacti (3.80 mg of gallic acid equivalent GAE/g dry weight [DW] and
      36.64 mg of quercetin equivalents [QE]/g DW, respectively).
      2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities (RSA) were
      correlated to bioactive compound contents. The Villanueva cacti had the highest
      %RSA at 42.31%, and the lowest activity was recorded in Copena V1 at 19.98%. In
      conclusion, we found that some of the 8 cactus pear cultivars studied may be used
      for their antioxidant compounds or antimicrobials to control or prevent the
      contamination of foods.

TI  - Chemical and physical defense traits in two sexual forms of Opuntia robusta in
      Central Eastern Mexico.
PG  - e89535
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0089535 [doi]
AB  - Sexually dimorphic plants provide an excellent opportunity for examining the
      differences in the extent of their defense against herbivores because they
      exhibit sex-related differences in reproductive investment. Such differences
      enable comparison of the sex with high reproduction expenses with the sex that
      expends less. The more costly sex is usually also better defended against
      herbivores. Generally, females are considered more valuable than hermaphrodites
      in terms of fitness; however, hermaphrodites are more valuable if they can
      produce seed by autonomous selfing, provided that the inbreeding depression is
      low and pollen is limited. We studied a gynodioecious population of Opuntia
      robusta from Central-Eastern Mexico, which has been reported to be trioecious,
      dioecious, or hermaphrodite, and addressed the following questions: 1) Is the
      hermaphrodite's reproductive output higher than the female's, and are
      hermaphrodites thus better defended? 2) Are plant tissues differentially
      defended? 3) Do trade-offs exist among different physical defense traits? and 4) 
      among physical and chemical defense traits? We found that 1) hermaphrodites had a
      higher seed output and more spines per areola than females and that their spines 
      contained less moisture. Non-reproductive hermaphrodite cladodes contained more
      total phenolic compounds (TPCs) than female ones. In addition, 2) hermaphrodite
      reproductive cladodes bore more spines than female cladodes, and 3) and 4) we
      found a negative relationship between spine number per areola and areola number
      per cladode and a positive relationship between spine number per areola per plant
      and TPC concentration per plant. Non-reproductive hermaphrodite cladodes
      contained a higher concentration of TPCs than female cladodes, and parental
      cladodes contained fewer TPCs than both reproductive and empty cladodes.

TI  - Biological activities of Schottenol and Spinasterol, two natural phytosterols
      present in argan oil and in cactus pear seed oil, on murine miroglial BV2 cells.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the biological activities of the
      major phytosterols present in argan oil (AO) and in cactus seed oil (CSO) in BV2 
      microglial cells. Accordingly, we first determined the sterol composition of AO
      and CSO, showing the presence of Schottenol and Spinasterol as major sterols in
      AO. While in CSO, in addition to these two sterols, we found mainly another
      sterol, the Sitosterol. The chemical synthesis of Schottenol and Spinasterol was 
      performed. Our results showed that these two phytosterols, as well as sterol
      extracts from AO or CSO, are not toxic to microglial BV2 cells. However,
      treatments by these phytosterols impact the mitochondrial membrane potential.
      Furthermore, both Schottenol and Spinasterol can modulate the gene expression of 
      two nuclear receptors, liver X receptor (LXR)-alpha and LXRbeta, their target
      genes ABCA1 and ABCG1. Nonetheless, only Schottenol exhibited a differential
      activation vis-a-vis the nuclear receptor LXRbeta. Thus Schottenol and
      Spinasterol can be considered as new LXR agonists, which may play protective
      roles by the modulation of cholesterol metabolism.

TI  - A perspective on natural products research and ethnopharmacology in Mexico: the
      eagle and the serpent on the prickly pear cactus.
PG  - 678-89
LID - 10.1021/np4009927 [doi]
AB  - Mexico's extraordinarily rich cultural and floristic diversity has fascinated
      explorers and researchers ever since the "New World" was discovered for and by
      Europeans. For many decades, natural product research has been a very active
      field of research in Mexico, and there also are some ongoing ethnopharmacological
      research efforts. This review provides an overview and critical appraisal on some
      key developments in these fields and examples of medicinal plants used by
      indigenous communities that have become of great local importance in Mexican
      popular medicine. In this review, the focus is on plants with effects on the CNS,
      diabetes, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory processes, and gastrointestinal
      disorders. While some of the major food plants consumed worldwide originate from 
      southern North America, only very few medicinal plants have become of major
      global importance. Opuntia species are now used increasingly to manage diabetes
      and metabolic syndrome and represent an example of a novel medicinal
      product/supplement. Undoubtedly, narcotic and mind-altering drugs both have
      received the widest scientific interest and have attracted considerable popular
      attention. The history of use of the indigenous Mexican Materia Medica in the
      context of research on local and popular resources specifically with regard to
      the diverse challenges in the context of studying the world's biodiversity and
      the development of comparative and semiquantitative ethnobotanical research
      methods is discussed herein. Natural product and ethnopharmacological research in
      Mexico seems to have been influenced by the political and societal developments
      originating from the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and subsequent
      conventions, which have not yet had the desired effect of giving value to these
      local resources, as they might deserve. Their equitable and sustainable
      implementation remains a challenge. Natural product research and
      ethnopharmacology will play a key role in developing an adequate evidence base
      for such products derived from local and traditional knowledge in Mexico.

TI  - Differences in tolerance to host cactus alkaloids in Drosophila koepferae and D. 
      buzzatii.
PG  - e88370
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0088370 [doi]
AB  - The evolution of cactophily in the genus Drosophila was a major ecological
      transition involving over a hundred species in the Americas that acquired the
      capacity to cope with a variety of toxic metabolites evolved as feeding
      deterrents in Cactaceae. D. buzzatii and D. koepferae are sibling cactophilic
      species in the D. repleta group. The former is mainly associated with the
      relatively toxic-free habitat offered by prickly pears (Opuntia sulphurea) and
      the latter has evolved the ability to use columnar cacti of the genera
      Trichocereus and Cereus that contain an array of alkaloid secondary compounds. We
      assessed the effects of cactus alkaloids on fitness-related traits and evaluated 
      the ability of D. buzzatii and D. koepferae to exploit an artificial novel toxic 
      host. Larvae of both species were raised in laboratory culture media to which we 
      added increasing doses of an alkaloid fraction extracted from the columnar cactus
      T. terschekii. In addition, we evaluated performance on an artificial novel host 
      by rearing larvae in a seminatural medium that combined the nutritional quality
      of O. sulphurea plus amounts of alkaloids found in fresh T. terschekii.
      Performance scores in each rearing treatment were calculated using an index that 
      took into account viability, developmental time, and adult body size. Only D.
      buzzatii suffered the effects of increasing doses of alkaloids and the artificial
      host impaired viability in D. koepferae, but did not affect performance in D.
      buzzatii. These results provide the first direct evidence that alkaloids are key 
      determinants of host plant use in these species. However, the results regarding
      the artificial novel host suggest that the effects of alkaloids on performance
      are not straightforward as D. koepferae was heavily affected. We discuss these
      results in the light of patterns of host plan evolution in the Drosophila repleta
      group.

      stress responses. Up-regulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) is among the best
      studied mechanisms of the cellular stress response. An extract of the prickly
      pear cactus (Opuntia ficus indica), Pro-Tex, a soluble variant of TEX-OE((R)),
      may induce expression of HSPs and reduce negative effects of cellular stress.
      Pro-Tex therefore is used to ameliorate conditions during stressful
      aquaculture-related practices. We tested Pro-Tex in zebrafish (Danio rerio),
      common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) and yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi)
      exposed to aquaculture-relevant stressors (thermal stress, net confinement,
      transport) and assessed its effects on stress physiology. Heat shock produced a
      mild increase in hsp70 mRNA expression in 5-day-old zebrafish larvae. Pro-Tex
      increased basal hsp70 mRNA expression, but decreased heat-shock-induced
      expression of hsp70 mRNA. In carp, Pro-Tex increased plasma cortisol and glucose 
      levels, while it did not affect the mild stress response (increased plasma
      cortisol and glucose) to net confinement. In gills, and proximal and distal
      intestine, stress increased hsp70 mRNA expression; in the distal intestine, an
      additive enhancement of hsp70 mRNA expression by Pro-Tex was seen under stress.
      In yellowtail kingfish, Pro-Tex reduced the negative physiological effects of
      transport more efficiently than when fish were sedated with AQUI-S((R)). Overall,
      our data indicate that Pro-Tex has protective effects under high levels of stress
      only. As Pro-Tex has potential for use in aquaculture, its functioning and impact
      on health and welfare of fish should be further studied.

AB  - Fermentation of natural products is emerging as an important processing method
      and is attracting a lot of attention because it may have the advantage of having 
      a new biological function. In this study, fruits of Opuntia ficus-indica were
      enzymatically hydrolyzed and then fermented with two species of yeast. We
      identified novel prominent markers in enzymatically hydrolyzed O. ficus-indica
      (EO) and fermented O. ficus-indica (FO) samples by using an ultra-performance
      liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We also
      evaluated the effect of EO and FO on photoaging of skin cells exposed to
      ultraviolet radiation. We identified the major fermented metabolite in the FO as 
      ferulic acid. Our in vitro study indicated that FO significantly enhanced the
      concentration of pro-collagen type 1 than the EO, by increasing the TGF-beta1
      production.

PG  - 25-33
LID - 10.1007/s13197-011-0470-5 [doi]
AB  - In order to increase the diffusion of cactus pear fruits, in this study, the
      proper maturity index for peeling and processing them as ready-to-eat product was
      evaluated and characterized. Thereafter, the effects of different storage
      temperatures and modified atmosphere conditions on the marketability of
      ready-to-eat cactus pear were studied. The storage of ready-to-eat fruits at 4
      degrees C in both passive (air) and semi-active (10 kPa O2 and 10 kPa CO2)
      modified atmosphere improved the marketability by 30%, whereas the storage at 8
      degrees C caused a dangerous reduction in O2 partial pressure inside modified
      atmosphere packages, due to fruits' increased metabolic activity. A very low
      level of initial microbial growth was detected, while a severe increase in
      mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria was shown in control samples at both
      temperatures during storage; an inhibitory effect of modified atmosphere on
      microbial growth was also observed. In conclusion, modified atmosphere improved
      only the marketability of fruits stored at 4 degrees C; whereas the storage at 8 
      degrees C resulted in deleterious effects on the ready-to-eat fruits, whether
      stored in air or in modified atmosphere.

      littoralis, with the two main components being the furanoid forms of cis-linalool
      oxide (10.8%) and trans-linalool oxide (8.8%). Fatty acid-derived compounds
      dominated the essential oil of O. ficus-indica with linoleic acid (22.3%),
      palmitic acid (12.7%), lauric acid (10.5%) and myristic acid (4.2%) as major
      fatty acids. O. prolifera oil was composed of 46.6% alkanes and the primary
      hydrocarbon component was heptadecane (19.2%). Sixteen compounds were common to
      all the three Opuntia species.

PG  - 118-27
LID - 10.1097/MPA.0b013e318296f903 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Opuntia humifusa 
      (OH) on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis (AP). METHODS: Acute pancreatitis was
      induced via intraperitoneal injection of cholecystokinin analog cerulein (50
      mug/kg). In the OH pretreatment group, OH was administered intraperitoneally
      (100, 250, or 500 mg/kg) 1 hour before first cerulein injection. In the
      posttreatment group, OH was administered intraperitoneally (500 mg/kg) 1 hour
      after the first cerulein injection. Furthermore, we isolated the pancreatic
      acinar cells using collagenase method, then investigated the acinar cell
      viability, cytokine productions, and the regulating mechanisms. RESULTS: The both
      pretreatment and posttreatment of OH treatment attenuated the severity of AP, as 
      shown by the histology of the pancreas and lung, and inhibited neutrophil
      infiltration; serum amylase and lipase activities; proinflammatory cytokine
      expression such as interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha;
      and cell death including apoptosis and necrosis. Furthermore, OH inhibited the
      activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that
      OH reduces the severity of AP by inhibiting acinar cell death through c-Jun
      N-terminal kinases.

TI  - Ecophysiological and anatomical mechanisms behind the nurse effect: which are
      more important? A multivariate approach for cactus seedlings.
PG  - e81513
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0081513 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cacti establish mostly occurs under the canopy of nurse plants which 
      provide a less stressful micro-environment, although mechanisms underlying this
      process are unknown. The impact of the combination of light and watering
      treatments on Opuntia streptacantha (Cactaceae) seedlings was examined.
      METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ecophysiological [titratable acidity, osmotic
      potential ('solute potential', Psis ), relative growth rate (RGR) and their
      components (NAR, SLA, and LWR)], anatomical (chloroplast density, chloroplast
      frequency, and cell area), and environmental [photosynthetic photon flux density 
      (PPFD) and air temperature] sets of variables were analyzed, assessing
      relationships between them and measuring the intensity of the relationships.
      Three harvests were carried out at days 15, 30, and 45. Psis and acidity content 
      were the most important responses for seedling establishment. The main anatomical
      and environmental variables were chloroplast density and water availability,
      respectively. Opuntia streptacantha seedlings establish better in the
      shade-watering treatment, due to higher Psis and acidity, unaffected
      chloroplasts, and lower PPFD. In addition, the chloroplasts of cells under
      high-light and non-watering treatment were clumped closer to the center of the
      cytosol than those under shade-drought, to avoid photoinhibition and/or to better
      distribute or utilize the penetrating light in the green plant tissue.
      CONCLUSIONS: Opuntia seedlings grow better under the shade, although they can
      tolerate drought in open spaces by increasing and moving chloroplasts and
      avoiding drastic decreases in their Psis . This tolerance could have important
      implications for predicting the impact of climate change on natural desert
      regeneration, as well as for planning reforestation-afforestation practices, and 
      rural land uses.

TI  - Indicaxanthin from cactus pear fruit exerts anti-inflammatory effects in
      carrageenin-induced rat pleurisy.
PG  - 185-92
LID - 10.3945/jn.113.183657 [doi]
AB  - Nutritional research has shifted recently from alleviating nutrient deficiencies 
      to chronic disease prevention. We investigated the activity of indicaxanthin, a
      bioavailable phytochemical of the betalain class from the edible fruit of Opuntia
      ficus-indica (L. Miller) in a rat model of acute inflammation. Rat pleurisy was
      achieved by injection of 0.2 mL of lambda-carrageenin in the pleural cavity, and 
      rats were killed 4, 24, and 48 h later; exudates were collected to analyze
      inflammatory parameters, such as nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), 
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha); cells 
      recruited in pleura were analyzed for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric 
      oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
      of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) activation. Indicaxanthin (0.5, 1, or 2
      mumol/kg), given orally before carrageenin, time- and dose-dependently, reduced
      the exudate volume (up to 70%) and the number of leukocytes recruited in the
      pleural cavity (up to 95%) at 24 h. Pretreatment with indicaxanthin at 2 mumol/kg
      inhibited the carrageenin-induced release of PGE(2) (91.4%), NO (67.7%), IL-1beta
      (53.6%), and TNF-alpha (71.1%), and caused a decrease of IL-1beta (34.5%),
      TNF-alpha (81.6%), iNOS (75.2%), and COX2 (87.7%) mRNA, as well as iNOS (71.9%)
      and COX-2 (65.9%) protein expression, in the recruited leukocytes. Indicaxanthin 
      inhibited time- and dose- dependently the activation of NF-kappaB, a key
      transcription factor in the whole inflammatory cascade. A pharmacokinetic study
      with a single 2 mumol/kg oral administration showed a maximum 0.22 +/- 0.02
      mumol/L (n = 15) plasma concentration of indicaxanthin, with a half-life of 1.15 
      +/- 0.11 h. When considering the high bioavailability of indicaxanthin in humans,
      our findings suggest that this dietary pigment has the potential to improve
      health and prevent inflammation-based disorders.

TI  - A critical review on the spray drying of fruit extract: effect of additives on
      physicochemical properties.
PG  - 449-73
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2011.587038 [doi]
AB  - Spray drying accomplishes drying while particles are suspended in the air and is 
      one method in the family of suspended particle processing systems, along with
      fluid-bed drying, flash drying, spray granulation, spray agglomeration, spray
      reaction, spray cooling, and spray absorption. This drying process is unique
      because it involves both particle formation and drying. The present paper reviews
      spray drying of fruit extracts, such as acai, acerola pomace, gac, mango, orange,
      cactus pear, opuntia stricta fruit, watermelon, and durian, and the effects of
      additives on physicochemical properties such as antioxidant activity, total
      carotenoid content, lycopene and beta-carotene content, hygroscopy, moisture
      content, volatile retention, stickiness, color, solubility, glass transition
      temperature, bulk density, rehydration, caking, appearance under electron
      microscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction. The literature clearly demonstrates
      that the effect of additives and encapsulation play a vital role in determining
      the physicochemical properties of fruit extract powder. The technical
      difficulties in spray drying of fruit extracts can be overcome by modifying the
      spray dryer design. It also reveals that spray drying is a novel technology for
      converting fruit extract into powder form.

TI  - Molecular and computational approaches to characterize thermostable laccase gene 
      from two xerophytic plant species.
PG  - 1445-59
LID - 10.1007/s12010-013-0611-6 [doi]
AB  - Laccases are blue multicopper oxidases that carry out single electron transfers
      in the oxidation of phenols to quinones. In plants, they confer structural
      stability to the cell wall. Thermostable laccases were identified in xerophytes
      Cereus pterogonus and Opuntia vulgaris that could be used in biotechnology and
      industrial processes. Polyclonal anti-laccase antibodies were generated against
      purified laccase enzyme isoforms capable of 98-99% inhibition of the catalytic
      activity. Antibodies raised against lower molecular weight isoforms inhibited 70%
      of the catalytic activity of higher molecular forms. Only 20% inhibition was
      noted when assayed in reverse. A partial gene sequence of thermostable xerophytic
      laccase comprising 712 and 880 bp was identified employing cDNA as template. The 
      nucleotide sequence was submitted to GenBank. The gene sequence was in silico
      translated into protein sequence and a 3-D structure was predicted using I-Tasser
      and Genesilico online servers that justified the experimental observations.
      Anti-laccase antibodies and nucleotide gene sequence of this thermostable plant
      laccase can be utilized for predicting laccase antigenic sequences and for
      cloning and expression of the thermostable eukaryotic laccase.

AB  - Cladode ultrastructural features of two prickly and two spineless Opuntia
      ficus-indica cultivars were examined using environmental scanning electron and
      atomic force microscopies. Observations focused on cladode as well as spine and
      glochid surface micromorphologies. Prickly cultivars were characterized by
      abundant cracked epicuticular wax deposits covering the cladode surface, with an 
      amorphous structure as observed by AFM, while less abundant waxy plates were
      observed by ESEM on spineless cultivar cladodes. Further AFM observations allowed
      a rough granular and crystalloid epicuticular wax structure to be distinguished
      in spineless cultivars. Regarding spine micromorphology, prickly cultivars had
      strong persistent spines, observed by ESEM as a compact arrangement of oblong
      epidermal cells with a rough granular structure. However, deciduous spines in
      spineless cultivars had a broken transversely fissured epidermis covering a
      parallel arrangement of fibres. Through AFM, the deciduous spine surface
      presented an irregular hilly and smooth microrelief while persistent spines
      exhibited rough helical filamentous prints. ESEM and AFM studies of cladode
      surfaces from prickly and spineless cactus pear cultivars revealed valuable
      micro-morphological details that ought to be extended to a large number of O.
      ficus-indica cultivars.

AB  - A simple and rapid method was developed for in vivo simultaneous determination of
      ascorbic-acid and antioxidant capacity in microdialysates from cladodes of
      Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller. The method is verified in water-stressed
      plants, as compared with a well-watered test controls. The microdialysis probe
      construction and insertion procedure was specifically developed to minimise the
      tissue trauma of the plant and to obtain optimal dialysis performance.
      Microdialysis was performed using a flow rate of 3 muL/min and the samples were
      analysed by HPLC coupled to electrochemical detection of ascorbic-acid and
      DPPH-determined antioxidant capacity. Our data indicate exponential decay of the 
      concentrations of the analysed compounds as a function of microdialysis sampling 
      time. Water-stressed Opuntia show decreased ascorbic acid levels and increased
      the others antioxidants.

PG  - 11995-2004
LID - 10.1021/jf401705h [doi]
AB  - Betalains were extracted and analyzed from Opuntia joconostle (the prickly pear
      known as xoconostle in Mexico). For the extraction, two solvent systems were
      used, methanol/water and ethanol/water. A three-variable Box-Behnken statistical 
      design was used for extraction: solvent concentration (0-80%, v/v), temperature
      (5-30 degrees C), and treatment time (10-30 min). The extraction and stability of
      betalains from xoconostle were studied using response surface methodology (RSM). 
      Techniques such as UV-vis, column chromatography, and HPLC were employed for the 
      separation and analysis of the main pigments present in the extracts. Maximum
      pigment concentration (92 mg/100 g of fruit) was obtained at a temperature of 15 
      degrees C and a time of 10 min for methanol/water (20:80), whereas maximum
      stability of the pigment was observed at pH 5 and a temperature of 25 degrees C. 
      HPLC chromatograms showed the main betalains of the xoconostle characterized were
      betalain, betanidin, and isobetalain.

TI  - Functional and hypoglycemic properties of nopal cladodes (O. ficus-indica) at
      different maturity stages using in vitro and in vivo tests.
PG  - 10981-6
LID - 10.1021/jf403834x [doi]
AB  - Nopal (Opuntia ficus-indica) cladodes are recommended for their therapeutic
      properties; their maturity stage may affect their biological properties. Cladodes
      of three maturity stages, from the same crop and location, were dehydrated and
      evaluated for some of their physicochemical and nutritional characteristics and
      antidiabetic properties. The flours of small and medium cladodes (SCF and MCF,
      respectively) had higher contents of dietary fiber, water absorption, swelling,
      and viscosity compared to those of the large cladode flour (LCF).
      Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, treated with MCF and SCF (doses of 50 mg/kg
      body weight), showed reduction of postprandial blood glucose on 46.0 and 23.6%,
      respectively (p < 0.05), in relation to the control; and LCF had no significant
      effect. In vitro, glucose diffusion tests showed similar ranking by the two
      former samples, whereas the latter was close to the control. Cladode maturity
      stages showed different fiber content and produced suspensions with differences
      in viscosity, which may affect in vitro and in vivo glucose responses.

TI  - Nutrient availability affects the response of the calcifying chlorophyte Halimeda
      opuntia (L.) J.V. Lamouroux to low pH.
PG  - 231-42
LID - 10.1007/s00425-013-1982-1 [doi]
AB  - Atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions cause a decrease in the pH and aragonite
      saturation state of surface ocean water. As a result, calcifying organisms are
      expected to suffer under future ocean conditions, but their physiological
      responses may depend on their nutrient status. Because many coral reefs
      experience high inorganic nutrient loads or seasonal changes in nutrient
      availability, reef organisms in localized areas will have to cope with elevated
      carbon dioxide and changes in inorganic nutrients. Halimeda opuntia is a dominant
      calcifying primary producer on coral reefs that contributes to coral reef
      accretion. Therefore, we investigated the carbon and nutrient balance of H.
      opuntia exposed to elevated carbon dioxide and inorganic nutrients. We measured
      tissue nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon content as well as the activity of enzymes
      involved in inorganic carbon uptake and nitrogen assimilation (external carbonic 
      anhydrase and nitrate reductase, respectively). Inorganic carbon content was
      lower in algae exposed to high CO(2), but calcification rates were not
      significantly affected by CO(2) or inorganic nutrients. Organic carbon was
      positively correlated to external carbonic anhydrase activity, while inorganic
      carbon showed the opposite correlation. Carbon dioxide had a significant effect
      on tissue nitrogen and organic carbon content, while inorganic nutrients affected
      tissue phosphorus and N:P ratios. Nitrate reductase activity was highest in algae
      grown under elevated CO(2) and inorganic nutrient conditions and lowest when
      phosphate was limiting. In general, we found that enzymatic responses were
      strongly influenced by nutrient availability, indicating its important role in
      dictating the local responses of the calcifying primary producer H. opuntia to
      ocean acidification.

TI  - Antioxidant and anticlastogenic capacity of prickly pear juice.
PG  - 4145-58
LID - 10.3390/nu5104145 [doi]
AB  - Plants belonging to the genus Opuntia spp. are the most abundant of the Cactaceae
      family, grown throughout America and the Mediterranean central area. Its fruit,
      known as cactus pear or prickly pear, is an oval berry grouped in different
      colors. Some studies have shown its antioxidant activities which may help in
      preventing chronic pathologies such as diabetes. The purpose of the study was to 
      evaluate the antioxidant capacity of three varieties of prickly pear juice
      (red-purple, white-green and yellow-orange) in five different concentrations
      (100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 mg/mL) by DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl
      radical) colorimetric method, selecting the best variety to determine its
      anticlastogenic potential against methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The results
      indicate that the highest antioxidant was found in the juice of the prickly pear 
      red-purple variety (PPRP), in all concentrations. Its anticlastogenic potential
      was therefore evaluated with a micronucleus assay. The experiment was run over
      two weeks. A negative control was included along with a positive control with MMS
      (40 mg/kg), a group of mice treated with PPRP (25 mL/kg), and three groups with
      PPRP (in doses of 25, 16.5 and 8.3 mL/kg) plus the mutagen. The PPRP was
      administered daily by oral gavage and the MMS was injected intraperitoneally five
      days prior to the end of the experiment. Blood samples were obtained at 0, 24,
      48, 72 and 96 h in order to determine the frequency of micronucleated
      polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPE). The results indicated that PPRP is not a
      genotoxic agent, on the contrary, it may reduce the number of MNPE. In this
      regard, the PPRP showed an anticlastogenic effect directly proportional to its
      concentrations. Thus, the highest protection was obtained with a concentration of
      25 mL/kg after 48 h of treatment.

TI  - Additive insulinogenic action of Opuntia ficus-indica cladode and fruit skin
      extract and leucine after exercise in healthy males.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/1550-2783-10-45 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral intake of a specific extract of Opuntia ficus-indica cladode and
      fruit skin (OpunDia) (OFI) has been shown to increase serum insulin concentration
      while reducing blood glucose level for a given amount of glucose ingestion after 
      an endurance exercise bout in healthy young volunteers. However, it is unknown
      whether OFI-induced insulin stimulation after exercise is of the same magnitude
      than the stimulation by other insulinogenic agents like leucine as well as
      whether OFI can interact with those agents. Therefore, the aims of the present
      study were: 1) to compare the degree of insulin stimulation by OFI with the
      effect of leucine administration; 2) to determine whether OFI and leucine have an
      additive action on insulin stimulation post-exercise. METHODS: Eleven subjects
      participated in a randomized double-blind cross-over study involving four
      experimental sessions. In each session the subjects successively underwent a 2-h 
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after a 30-min cycling bout at ~70% VO2max. At
      t0 and t60 during the OGTT, subjects ingested 75 g glucose and capsules
      containing either 1) a placebo; 2) 1000 mg OFI; 3) 3 g leucine; 4) 1000 mg OFI + 
      3 g leucine. Blood samples were collected before and at 30-min intervals during
      the OGTT for determination of blood glucose and serum insulin. RESULTS: Whereas
      no effect of leucine was measured, OFI reduced blood glucose at t90 by ~7% and
      the area under the glucose curve by ~15% and increased serum insulin
      concentration at t90 by ~35% compared to placebo (P<0.05). From t60 to the end of
      the OGTT, serum insulin concentration was higher in OFI+leucine than in placebo
      which resulted in a higher area under the insulin curve (+40%, P<0.05).
      CONCLUSION: Carbohydrate-induced insulin stimulation post-exercise can be further
      increased by the combination of OFI with leucine. OFI and leucine could be
      interesting ingredients to include together in recovery drinks to resynthesize
      muscle glycogen faster post-exercise. Still, it needs to be confirmed that such
      nutritional strategy effectively stimulates post-exercise muscle glycogen
      resynthesis.

TI  - The importance of pollinator generalization and abundance for the reproductive
      success of a generalist plant.
PG  - e75482
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0075482 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have examined separately how pollinator generalization and
      abundance influence plant reproductive success, but none so far has evaluated
      simultaneously the relative importance of these pollinator attributes. Here we
      evaluated the extent to which pollinator generalization and abundance influence
      plant reproductive success per visit and at the population level on a generalist 
      plant, Opuntia sulphurea (Cactaceae). We used field experiments and path analysis
      to evaluate whether the per-visit effect is determined by the pollinator's degree
      of generalization, and whether the population level effect (pollinator impact) is
      determined by the pollinator's degree of generalization and abundance. Based on
      the models we tested, we concluded that the per-visit effect of a pollinator on
      plant reproduction was not determined by the pollinators' degree of
      generalization, while the population-level impact of a pollinator on plant
      reproduction was mainly determined by the pollinators' degree of generalization. 
      Thus, generalist pollinators have the greatest species impact on pollination and 
      reproductive success of O. sulphurea. According to our analysis this greatest
      impact of generalist pollinators may be partly explained by pollinator abundance.
      However, as abundance does not suffice as an explanation of pollinator impact, we
      suggest that vagility, need for resource consumption, and energetic efficiency of
      generalist pollinators may also contribute to determine a pollinator's impact on 
      plant reproduction.

AB  - For this research, three different adsorbents, one untreated and two chemically
      activated, were prepared from Opuntia ficus-indica fruit waste. By the
      construction of adsorption isotherms, its adsorption capabilities and the
      viability of its use in the removal of textile basic and direct type dyes were
      determined. It was found that the adsorbent with the most adsorption capacity for
      basic dyes was the one activated with NaClO, and, for direct dyes, it was the one
      activated with NaOH. Langmuir and Freundlich equations isotherms were applied for
      the analysis of the experimental data. It was found that the Freundlich model
      best described the adsorption behavior. The adsorption capacity was improved when
      the pH of the dye solution had an acid value. The specific surface area of the
      adsorbents was calculated by means of methylene blue adsorption at 298 K to stay 
      within a range between 348 and 643 m(2) g(-1). The FTIR spectroscopic
      characterization technique, the SEM, the point of zero charge, and the elemental 
      analysis show the chemical and physical characteristics of the studied
      adsorbents, which confirm the adsorption results obtained.

TI  - The importance of size and disorder in the cryoprotective effects of dehydrins.
PG  - 1376-86
LID - 10.1104/pp.113.226803 [doi]
AB  - Dehydrins protect plant proteins and membranes from damage during drought and
      cold. Vitis riparia K2 is a 48-residue protein that can protect lactate
      dehydrogenase from freeze-thaw damage by preventing the aggregation and
      denaturation of the enzyme. To further elucidate its mechanism, we used a series 
      of V. riparia K2 concatemers (K4, K6, K8, and K10) and natural dehydrins (V.
      riparia YSK2, 60 kilodalton peach dehydrin [PCA60], barley dehydrin5 [Dhn5],
      Thellungiella salsuginea dehydrin2 [TsDHN-2], and Opuntia streptacantha dehydrin1
      [OpsDHN-1]) to test the effect of the number of K-segments and dehydrin size on
      their ability to protect lactate dehydrogenase from freeze-thaw damage. The
      results show that the larger the hydrodynamic radius of the dehydrin, the more
      effective the cryoprotection. A similar trend is observed with polyethylene
      glycol, which would suggest that the protection is simply a nonspecific volume
      exclusion effect that can be manifested by any protein. However, structured
      proteins of a similar range of sizes did not show the same pattern and level of
      cryoprotection. Our results suggest that with respect to enzyme protection,
      dehydrins function primarily as molecular shields and that their intrinsic
      disorder is required for them to be an effective cryoprotectant. Lastly, we show 
      that the cryoprotection by a dehydrin is not due to any antifreeze protein-like
      activity, as has been reported previously.

TI  - A strategy to design efficient fermentation processes for traditional beverages
      production: prickly pear wine.
PG  - M1560-8
LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.12237 [doi]
AB  - This paper describes a methodology to establish an optimal process design for
      prickly pear wine production that preserves the peculiar and unique traits of
      traditional products, generating at the same time, technical information for
      appropriate design of both bioreactor and overall process. The strategy includes 
      alcoholic fermentation optimization by the mixed native culture composed by
      Pichia fermentans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, followed by malolactic
      fermentation optimization by Oenococcus oeni. The optimization criteria were
      based on multiple output functions: alcohol content, volatile compounds profile, 
      organic acids profile, and compound contents related to color, which were
      analyzed by spectroscopy-chromatography methods and sensory analysis. The results
      showed that the mixed culture inoculated into a bioreactor containing prickly
      pear juice with 20 degrees Bx of fermentable sugars concentration, processed at a
      constant temperature of 20 degrees C for 240 h, leads to a fermented product with
      9.93% (v/v) total alcohol content, and significant abundance of volatile
      compounds, which provide fruity and ethereal aromatic notes, complemented by a
      lively but not unpleasant acidity. This young wine was further subjected to
      malolactic fermentation at constant temperature (16 degrees C) for 192 h,
      decreasing malic acid, and balancing volatile compounds contents, thus resulting 
      in a product with better aroma and flavor perception, and a velvety feeling of
      long aftertaste. Repeated assays showed that the process is stable, predictable, 
      controllable, and reproducible. These results were used for process design and
      spreadsheet construction in order to simulate the process, and properly select
      and size the equipment required for such process.

TI  - Tes, Licuados, and Capsulas: herbal self-care remedies of Latino/Hispanic
      immigrants for type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 828-40
LID - 10.1177/0145721713504004 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this cross-sectional, descriptive study was to explore
      the characteristics of herbal remedy use for diabetes among Latinos/Hispanics
      with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A convenience sample of 75 Latino/Hispanic adults 
      with type 2 diabetes was recruited from community-based settings in North
      Carolina. Data were collected through face-to-face bilingual interviews. Measures
      included a demographic questionnaire; the Traditional, Complementary, and
      Alternative Practices Questionnaire; and biophysical indicators of A1C and body
      mass index. RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of the sample reported using herbal
      remedies for diabetes self-care. Forty-nine herbal products were identified. The 
      most commonly reported products were prickly pear cactus, aloe vera, celery, and 
      chayote. The perceived effectiveness of products varied; some said they helped "a
      lot" while others noted the development of side effects. Over three quarters
      (77%) of persons using herbal remedies reported concurrent use with prescribed
      medications. Also, some participants reported skipping or altering the dose of
      diabetes medications when using herbal remedies. Most (77%) reported not
      disclosing herbal remedy use to health care providers. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes
      educators and other health care providers need to ask Latino/Hispanic clients
      about their use of herbal remedies and become knowledgeable about herbal products
      to provide advice about safety.

TI  - Synergistic effects of algal overgrowth and corallivory on Caribbean
      reef-building corals.
PG  - 1667-74
AB  - Indirect biotic interactions play a crucial role in structuring ecological
      communities, but many of these interactions have not been explored. Algal
      competition and corallivory are two major stressors contributing to the decline
      of coral reefs. Here, we provide the first evidence of algal-induced corallivory 
      and synergistic effects between the two stressors on corals. When corals
      (Montastraeafaveolata) were placed in contact with algae (Halimeda opuntia)
      together with corallivorous fireworms (Hermodice carunculata) in aquaria, corals 
      suffered high tissue mortality. This mortality was reduced in the presence of
      algae only, and no mortality occurred in the presence of fireworms only or when
      excluding both algae and fireworms. These findings were supported by field
      observations showing a predominance of fireworms inside algae contacting live
      corals, and by an in situ experiment demonstrating higher coral mortality in
      contact with algae left undisturbed than with algae from which all mobile
      epifauna were periodically removed. Among the main contributing mechanisms, we
      suggest that algal contact produces decaying coral tissue that attracts the
      corallivore and enhances its aggregation behavior. Our study demonstrates an
      indirect effect pathway by which algae can impact corals, which shares
      similarities with the classic models of apparent competition and habitat
      facilitation.

PG  - 305-18
LID - 10.1556/ABiol.64.2013.3.4 [doi]
AB  - Fasciated and normal stem segments of Opuntia microdasys, Opuntia cylindrica,
      Huernia primulina and Euphorbia lactea were collected from the same plant and
      compared for their anatomy, water relations and genetic variations. Anatomical
      differences in terms of thickness of cuticle, vascular bundle, xylem and phloem
      were analyzed in both normal and fasciated stems. The mucilage cells were higher 
      in the fasciated form of Opuntia microdasys than that in the normal form. Water
      status in terms of total water content (TWC), water deficit and relative water
      content (RWC) was influenced by fasciation. Genetic variations were tested in
      normal and fasciated stems using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
      fingerprints and SDS-PAGE of soluble protein extracts. SDS-PAGE protein and RAPD 
      analysis confirmed that normal and fasciated tissues were genetically different. 
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) yielded different polymorphic banding patterns
      that were unique to each primer and distinguishable over all samples. The PCR
      results of normal and fasciated samples were significantly different in cases of 
      primers P1, P2 and P3. These results indicate that occurrence of fasciation in
      Opuntia microdasys, Opuntia cylindrica, Huernia primulina and Euphorbia lactea is
      an epigenetic mutation of tissues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to record the use, and knowledge that residents from
      Sao Francisco community (Paraiba, Brazil) have regarding the Cactaceae. METHODS: 
      Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 118 informants; 50 men and 68
      women. The cacti cited in this study were organised into use categories and use
      values were calculated. Differences in the values applied to species and use
      categories by men and women were compared via a G test (Williams). RESULTS: The
      nine species identified were: Cereus jamacaru DC., Melocactus bahiensis (Brtitton
      & Rose) Luetzelb., Nopalea cochenillifera (L.) Salm-Dyck., Opuntia ficus indica
      (L.) Mill, Opuntia stricta (Haw.) Haw., Pilosocereus gounellei (F.A.C. Weber)
      Byles & Rowley, Pilosocereus pachycladus F. Ritter, Tacinga inamoena (K. Schum)
      N.P. Taylor & Stuppy, Tacinga palmadora (Britton & Rose) N.P. Taylor & Stuppy. In
      total, 1,129 use citations were recorded, divided into 11 categories. The use
      value categories with the highest scores were forage (0.42), food (0.30) and
      construction (building) (0.25). P. pachycladus showed the greatest use value,
      versatility and number of plant parts used. CONCLUSION: The survey showed that
      the Cactaceae is extremely important for several uses and categories attributed
      to different species. Apart from contributing to the ethnobotanical knowledge of 
      the Cactaceae, another important focus of this study was to reinforce the
      necessity for further studies that record the traditional knowledge about this
      plant family, which has been lost in younger generations.

AB  - Functional response of the predator Chilocorus cacti (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera:
      Coccinellidae) on five densities of Dactylopius opuntiae (Cockerell) (Hemiptera: 
      Dactylopiidae) female adults was assessed under laboratory conditions. The
      searching efficiency of C. cacti significantly decreased as prey density
      increased. The logistic regression for the predator had a negative and
      significant linear parameter indicating a type II functional response. Non-linear
      regression for Holling predator equation estimated a handling time of 1.79 +/-
      0.129 h and attack rate coefficient of 0.1003 +/- 0.030. Most of this handling
      time was because the predator spent a lot of time removing the waxy coating that 
      protects adult females of D. opuntiae. Chilocorus cacti consumes females of D.
      opuntiae in their reproductive stage; therefore, it could be an effective natural
      enemy to suppress or regulate low density populations of D. opuntiae, preventing 
      them to reach high densities.

PG  - 415-23

AB  - Dietary redox-active/antioxidant phytochemicals may help control or mitigate the 
      inflammatory response in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the present
      study, the anti-inflammatory activity of indicaxanthin (Ind), a pigment from the 
      edible fruit of cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica, L.), was shown in an IBD model
      consisting of a human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-2 cells) stimulated
      by IL-1beta, a cytokine known to play a major role in the initiation and
      amplification of inflammatory activity in IBD. The exposure of Caco-2 cells to
      IL-1beta brought about the activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX-1) and the generation
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to activate intracellular signalling leading to 
      the activation of NF-kappaB, with the over-expression of inflammatory enzymes and
      release of pro-inflammatory mediators. The co-incubation of the cells with Ind,
      at a nutritionally relevant concentration (5-25 muM), and IL-1beta prevented the 
      release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, PGE2 and NO, the
      formation of ROS and the loss of thiols in a dose-dependent manner. The
      co-incubation of the cells with Ind and IL-1beta also prevented the
      IL-1beta-induced increase of epithelial permeability. It was also shown that the 
      activation of NOX-1 and NF-kappaB was prevented by Ind and the expression of
      COX-2 and inducible NO synthase was reduced. The uptake of Ind in Caco-2 cell
      monolayers appeared to be unaffected by the inflamed state of the cells. In
      conclusion, our findings suggest that the dietary pigment Ind may have the
      potential to modulate inflammatory processes at the intestinal level.

AB  - Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the extraction of
      crude polysaccharides from Opuntia dillenii (Ker-Gaw) Haw. A three-level,
      four-variable Box-Behnken design was employed to obtain the best possible
      combination of extraction temperature (80-90 degrees C), extraction time (50-70
      min), number of extraction cycle (1-3 times), and ratio of water to raw material 
      (8:1-12:1, v/w) for maximum yield of crude polysaccharide. Besides, the
      antioxidant capacity of crude polysaccharide was evaluated by DPPH assay. The
      results showed that optimized extraction conditions were extraction temperature
      85 degrees C, extraction time 63.7 min, extraction 2 times and ratio of water to 
      raw material 11.14:1. Under these conditions, the experimental yield was 27.36
      +/- 0.21%, which is well in close agreement with the value (27.44%) predicted by 
      RSM model. Pharmacological test showed that O. dillenii crude polysaccharides had
      a good antioxidant activity.

TI  - Enzyme-assisted extraction of cactus bioactive molecules under high hydrostatic
      pressure.
PG  - 850-6
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.6317 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To improve the extraction and recovery of bioactive materials from
      cactus, the present study investigated the effect of polysaccharide-degrading
      enzymes [Rapidase-Viscozyme mixture, 1/3 (v/v)] treatment under high hydrostatic 
      pressure (HHP). RESULTS: The dry weight of the extract increased with the use of 
      increasing pressure regardless of enzyme treatment. However, the polyphenol
      content showed a tendency to decrease with the increase in pressure in the cactus
      extract with or without enzyme treatment. The enzyme-assisted extraction resulted
      in an increase of dry weight and polyphenol content in the cactus extract. The
      total sugar and reducing sugar contents of the cactus extract increased with
      increasing pressure in enzyme-assisted extraction. The uronic acid content of the
      cactus extract showed a pattern similar to that of the reducing sugars. The
      enzyme-assisted extraction also increased the contents of taxifolin, quercetin
      and isorhametin. The cactus extract obtained through enzyme-assisted extraction
      showed intense scavenging activity of both DPPH and ABTS radicals. The crude
      polysaccharides isolated from the extract (51.2% at 1000 microg mL(-)(1) for HHP 
      extraction at 300 MPa) had higher anti-complementary activity than the others
      except for lipopolysaccharide (60.00% at 1000 microg mL(-)(1)). HHP extraction
      and enzyme-assisted extraction using HHP showed an increase of anti-complementary
      activity compared with the heat and enzyme controls, respectively. CONCLUSION:
      Overall, the use of HHP in enzyme-assisted extraction resulted in more efficient 
      extraction than the use of enzyme treatment alone.

TI  - Programmed cell death promotes male sterility in the functional dioecious Opuntia
      stenopetala (Cactaceae).
PG  - 789-800
LID - 10.1093/aob/mct141 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The sexual separation in dioecious species has interested
      biologists for decades; however, the cellular mechanism leading to unisexuality
      has been poorly understood. In this study, the cellular changes that lead to male
      sterility in the functionally dioecious cactus, Opuntia stenopetala, are
      described. METHODS: The spatial and temporal patterns of programmed cell death
      (PCD) were determined in the anthers of male and female flowers using scanning
      electron microscopy analysis and histological observations, focusing attention on
      the transition from bisexual to unisexual development. In addition, terminal
      deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling assays were used as
      an indicator of DNA fragmentation to corroborate PCD. KEY RESULTS: PCD was
      detected in anthers of both female and male flowers, but their patterns differed 
      in time and space. Functionally male individuals developed viable pollen, and
      normal development involved PCD on each layer of the anther wall, which occurred 
      progressively from the inner (tapetum) to the outer layer (epidermis).
      Conversely, functional female individuals aborted anthers by premature and
      displaced PCD. In anthers of female flowers, the first signs of PCD, such as a
      nucleus with irregular shape, fragmented and condensed chromatin, high
      vacuolization and condensed cytoplasm, occurred at the microspore mother cell
      stage. Later these features were observed simultaneously in all anther wall
      layers, connective tissue and filament. Neither pollen formation nor anther
      dehiscence was detected in female flowers of O. stenopetala due to total anther
      disruption. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal and spatial changes in the patterns of PCD are 
      responsible for male sterility of female flowers in O. stenopetala. Male
      fertility requires the co-ordination of different events, which, when altered,
      can lead to male sterility and to functionally unisexual individuals. PCD could
      be a widespread mechanism in the determination of functionally dioecious species.

TI  - Dietary feeding of Opuntia humifusa inhibits UVB radiation-induced carcinogenesis
      by reducing inflammation and proliferation in hairless mouse model.
PG  - 1208-15
LID - 10.1111/php.12113 [doi]
AB  - It has been validated that ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation induced both squamous 
      and basal cell carcinomas, as a tumor initiator and promoter. Opuntia humifusa is
      a member of the Cactaceae family which has been demonstrated in our previous
      study to have a chemopreventive effect in 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and
      12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced skin carcinogenesis models.
      Therefore, this study was designed to determine the protective effects of O.
      humifusa against photocarcinogenesis. O. humifusa was administrated to mice as a 
      dietary feeding, following exposure to UVB radiation (180 mJ/cm(2)) twice a week 
      of 30 weeks for skin tumor development in hairless mice. Dietary O. humifusa
      inhibited UVB-induced epidermal hyperplasia, infiltration of leukocytes, level of
      myeloperoxidase and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
      in UVB exposed skin. Also, O. humifusa significantly inhibited both protein and
      mRNA expression level of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), 
      proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin D1 compared to the non-O.
      humifusa treated group. Collectively, these results suggest that O. humifusa
      could inhibit photocarcinogenesis in mouse skin and that protective effect is
      associated with the inhibition of not only UVB-induced inflammatory responses
      involving COX-2, iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines, but also the down-regulation
      of UVB-induced cellular proliferation.

AB  - We investigated whether the combination of phytochemicals and acetic acid in the 
      form of fruit vinegar provides an additive effect on changes of mRNA levels
      related to fatty acid oxidation in human hepatocyte (HepG2). Among the seven
      fruit vinegars (Rubuscoreanus, Opuntia, blueberry, cherry, red ginseng, mulberry,
      and pomegranate) studied, treatment of HepG2 with pomegranate vinegar (PV) at
      concentrations containing 1 mM acetic acid showed the highest in vitro
      potentiating effect on the mRNA expression levels of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor alpha, carnitinepalmitoyl transferase-1, and
      acyl-CoA oxidase compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Reversed-phase liquid 
      chromatography in combination with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
      analysis revealed four potential compounds (punicalagin B, ellagic acid, and two 
      unidentified compounds) responsible for altered gene expression in HepG2 cells
      treated with PV as compared with the others. Further investigations are warranted
      to determine if drinking PV beverages may help to maintain a healthy body weight 
      in overweight subjects.

      ficus-indica) skin in a reflux system using response surface methodology.
PG  - 436-42
LID - 10.1016/S2221-1691(13)60093-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To extract, quantify, and evaluate the phenolic content in Opuntia
      ficus-indica skin for their antioxidant capacity with three different methods
      (ABTS, DPPH, and lipid oxidation) and to optimize the extraction conditions
      (time, temperature and ethanol concentration) in a reflux system. METHODS: The
      extraction process was done using a reflux system. A San Cristobal II
      experimental design with three variables and three levels was used. The variables
      evaluated were time of extraction (h), concentration of ethanol (%, v/v) and
      temperature ( degrees C). The extraction process was optimized using a response
      surface methodology. RESULTS: It was observed that at higher temperature more
      phenolic compounds were extracted, but the antioxidant capacity was decreased.
      The optimum conditions for phenolic compounds extraction and antioxidant capacity
      mixing the three methods were as follows: 45% of ethanol, 80 degrees C and 2
      hours of extraction. Values obtained in our results are little higher that other 
      previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded the by-products of Opuntia 
      ficus-indica represent a good source of natural antioxidants with possible
      applications in food, cosmetics or drugs industries.

      and calciuria in adult Mexican women.
LID - 10.3402/fnr.v57i0.19106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intake of dehydrated nopal (DN) at a high stage of maturity along
      with high calcium content could improve bone mineral density (BMD) and calciuria 
      and thus prevent osteoporosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of calcium
      intake from a vegetable source (DN) on BMD and calciuria covering a 2-year period
      in menopausal and non-menopausal women with low bone mass (LBM). METHODS: The
      study was quasi-experimental, blinded, and randomized, and included 131 Mexican
      women aged 35-55. Urinary calcium/creatinine index (CCI) was determined; BMD was 
      analyzed on lumbar spine and total hip regions. Four groups were studied: Control
      group (CG), women with normocalciuria and a minimum dose of DN; experimental
      group 1 (EG1), women with hypercalciuria and a minimum dose of DN; experimental
      group 2 (EG2), women with hypercalciuria, and a maximum dose of DN; and normal
      group (NG) for reference in BMD. RESULTS: After the first semester of treatment, 
      calciuria levels in women from both experimental groups returned to normal,
      remaining constant for the rest of the treatment. The percentage difference in
      BMD increased in the total hip region in the CG (pre 4.5% and post 2.1%) and EG2 
      (pre 1.8% and post 2.5%) groups significantly in comparison to NG and EG1, which 
      exhibited a significant decrease in their BMD. BMD increased only for the lumbar 
      region in the EG2 group (premenopausal). CONCLUSION: The use of a vegetable
      calcium source such as nopal improves BMD in women with LBM in the total hip and 
      lumbar spine regions principally in the premenopausal women, maintaining constant
      and normal calciuria levels.

AB  - The costs and life cycle impacts of microalgae harvesting for biofuel production 
      were investigated. Algae were grown in semi-continuous culture in pilot-scale
      photobioreactors under natural light with anaerobic digester centrate as the feed
      source. Algae suspensions were collected and the optimal coagulant dosages for
      metal salts (alum, ferric chloride), cationic polymer (Zetag 8819), anionic
      polymer (E-38) and natural coagulants (Moringa Oleifera and Opuntia ficus-indica 
      cactus) were determined using jar tests. The relative dewaterability of the algae
      cake was estimated by centrifugation. Alum, ferric chloride and cationic polymer 
      could all achieve >91% algae recovery at optimal dosages. Life cycle assessment
      (LCA) and cost analysis results revealed that cationic polymer had the lowest
      cost but the highest environmental impacts, while ferric chloride had the highest
      cost and lowest environmental impacts. Based on the LCA results, belt presses are
      the recommended algae dewatering technology prior to oil extraction.

AB  - Carbohydrates partially liberated by acid hydrolysis of plant fiber can be
      separated by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC),
      ligand-exchange liquid chromatography or other forms of LC with ion-exchange
      columns. However, the robust hydrogen-exchange columns show co-elution of
      galactose, xylose and mannose. Free solution capillary electrophoresis (CE) can
      be used without derivatization at pH 12.6 and was found to provide a higher
      resolution of galactose and xylose than common LC with no sample pre-treatment
      required, other than dilution, within 26min. CE was able to provide resolution
      higher than 0.79 for all separated carbohydrates, and the RSDs of determined
      concentrations lower than 10% for concentrations above 1.3gL(-1). A quantitative 
      comparison between CE and HPLC revealed that up to 22% more carbohydrates are
      quantified with CE. Direct UV detection in CE of mono- and disaccharides is
      unexpectedly possible at 270nm. NMR analysis shows that alkaline degradation is
      too slow to explain this detection. This CE detection sensitivity is increased by
      the electric field and our CE and NMR analyses are consistent with a
      photo-oxidation process.

AB  - The seed composition of four varieties of Opuntia ficus-indica growing in Algeria
      was investigated. Seeds ground into a fine powder were first, subjected to oil
      extraction and fatty acids analysis. The phenolic compounds were then extracted
      from the defatted powder of seeds in order to be quantified and characterised by 
      liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) and to nuclear
      magnetic resonance (LC-NMR) approaches. In addition, an evaluation of the
      antioxidant activity of the phenolic extracts was investigated. Gas
      chromatography analysis of the seed oil showed high percentages of linoleic acid 
      in the four varieties ranging from 58% to 63%. The phenolic profile of the
      Opuntia ficus-indica seeds displayed a high complexity, with more than 20
      compounds detected at 330 nm after the LC separation. Among them, three isomers
      of feruloyl-sucrose were firmly identified and another was strongly supposed to
      be a sinapoyl-diglycoside. High correlations were found between phenolic content 
      in the defatted seed extracts and their antioxidant activity. The data indicate
      that the defatted cactus seed wastes still contain various components that
      constitute a source for natural foods.

AB  - Cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) fruit is a berry with a tasty pulp full of
      seeds that constitutes about 10-15% of the edible pulp. In Mexico, cactus pear is
      mainly consumed fresh, but also has the potential to be processed in other
      products such as juice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of
      different ultrasound conditions at amplitude levels ranging (40% and 60% for 10, 
      15, 25 min; 80% for 3, 5, 8, 10, 15 and 25 min) on the characteristics of purple 
      cactus pear juice. The evaluated parameters were related with the quality
      (stability, degrees Brix, pH), microbial growth, total phenolic compounds,
      ascorbic acid and antioxidant activity (ABTS, DPPH and % chelating activity) of
      purple cactus pear juices. The ultrasound treatment for time period of 15 and 25 
      min significantly reduced the microbial count in 15 and 25 min, without affecting
      the juice quality and its antioxidant properties. Juice treated at 80% of
      amplitude level showed an increased of antioxidant compounds. Our results
      demonstrated that sonication is a suitable technique for cactus pear processing. 
      This technology allows the achievement of juice safety and quality standards
      without compromising the retention of antioxidant compounds.

AB  - The present study was envisaged to evaluate the efficacy of ethno-medicinal plant
      aqueous extracts such as Allium sativum, Lawsonia inermis, and Opuntia ficus
      indica in vitro in comparison with the chemotherapeutic agent, Oxyclozanide on
      Fasciola gigantica adults. The efficacy was evaluated by gross visual motility
      and mortality of F. gigantica with score index, light microscopic examination of 
      carmine stained flukes and histopathology of treated flukes. Based on the in
      vitro trials conducted using above plant extracts at 1 percent, 2.5 percent and 5
      percent concentration, the extracts of O. ficus indica showed flukicidal effect
      at 2.5 and 5% concentration. However A. sativum and L. inermis were effective at 
      5% concentration only. The study indicated the potential for developing
      herbal-based anthelmintics to control F. gigantica in livestock.

TI  - Effect of Opuntia humifusa supplementation and acute exercise on insulin
      sensitivity and associations with PPAR-gamma and PGC-1alpha protein expression in
      skeletal muscle of rats.
PG  - 7140-54

AB  - This study examined whether Opuntia humifusa (O. humifusa), which is a member of 
      the Cactaceae family, supplementation and acute swimming exercise affect insulin 
      sensitivity and associations with PPAR-gamma and PGC-1alpha protein expression in
      rats. Thirty-two rats were randomly divided into four groups (HS: high fat diet
      sedentary group, n = 8; HE: high fat diet acute exercise group, n = 8; OS: 5% O. 
      humifusa supplemented high fat diet sedentary group, n = 8; OE: 5% O. humifusa
      supplemented high fat diet acute exercise group, n = 8). Rats in the HE and OE
      swam for 120 min. before being sacrificed. Our results indicated that serum
      glucose level, fasting insulin level and homeostasis model assessment of insulin 
      resistance (HOMA-IR) in OS were significantly lower compared to those of the HS
      (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.05). In addition, PPAR-gamma protein expression in the
      OS and OE was significantly higher than that of the HS and HE, respectively (p < 
      0.05, p < 0.01). PGC-1alpha and GLUT-4 protein expressions in the OS were
      significantly higher compared to those of the HS (p < 0.05, p < 0.05). From these
      results, O. humifusa supplementation might play an important role for improving
      insulin sensitivity through elevation of PPAR-gamma, PGC-1alpha, and GLUT-4
      protein expression in rat skeletal muscle.

TI  - Equivalency of Galapagos giant tortoises used as ecological replacement species
      to restore ecosystem functions.
PG  - 701-9
LID - 10.1111/cobi.12038 [doi]
AB  - Loss of key plant-animal interactions (e.g., disturbance, seed dispersal, and
      herbivory) due to extinctions of large herbivores has diminished ecosystem
      functioning nearly worldwide. Mitigating for the ecological consequences of large
      herbivore losses through the use of ecological replacements to fill extinct
      species' niches and thereby replicate missing ecological functions has been
      proposed. It is unknown how different morphologically and ecologically a
      replacement can be from the extinct species and still provide similar functions. 
      We studied niche equivalency between 2 phenotypes of Galapagos giant tortoises
      (domed and saddlebacked) that were translocated to Pinta Island in the Galapagos 
      Archipelago as ecological replacements for the extinct saddlebacked giant
      tortoise (Chelonoidis abingdonii). Thirty-nine adult, nonreproductive tortoises
      were introduced to Pinta Island in May 2010, and we observed tortoise resource
      use in relation to phenotype during the first year following release. Domed
      tortoises settled in higher, moister elevations than saddlebacked tortoises,
      which favored lower elevation arid zones. The areas where the tortoises settled
      are consistent with the ecological conditions each phenotype occupies in its
      native range. Saddlebacked tortoises selected areas with high densities of the
      arboreal prickly pear cactus (Opuntia galapageia) and mostly foraged on the
      cactus, which likely relied on the extinct saddlebacked Pinta tortoise for seed
      dispersal. In contrast, domed tortoises did not select areas with cactus and
      therefore would not provide the same seed-dispersal functions for the cactus as
      the introduced or the original, now extinct, saddlebacked tortoises.
      Interchangeability of extant megaherbivores as replacements for extinct forms
      therefore should be scrutinized given the lack of equivalency we observed in
      closely related forms of giant tortoises. Our results also demonstrate the value 
      of trial introductions of sterilized individuals to test niche equivalency among 
      candidate analog species.

PG  - 643-9
LID - 10.1007/s10265-013-0558-2 [doi]
AB  - Fungal attack under light reduces mechanical resistance of the testa of Opuntia
      seeds, making it easier for the embryo to emerge. However, the effect of fungi on
      Opuntia seed germination in darkness is unknown. We evaluated the combined
      effects of light and inoculation with Phoma medicaginis, Trichoderma harzianum,
      Trichoderma koningii, and Penicillium chrysogenum on germination of O.
      streptacantha, O. leucotricha, and O. robusta seeds, from central Mexico. We also
      evaluated the combined effects of seed age (2-, 3-, and 12-year-old seeds) and
      presence of fungi on the testa on O. streptacantha germination. All fungal
      species eroded the funicular envelope and promoted seed germination for O.
      leucotricha and O. streptacantha, but did more so in light than in darkness. For 
      the latter species, younger seeds inoculated with fungi had lower germination
      than older ones. For O. robusta, we found that seeds inoculated with P.
      medicaginis and T. harzianum had similar germination in light and in darkness.
      Our results strongly indicate that deterioration of the testa by fungi is higher 
      in light than in darkness.

TI  - A natural fiber complex reduces body weight in the overweight and obese: a
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 58-64
LID - 10.1002/oby.20244 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A proprietary natural fiber complex (Litramine IQP G-002AS) derived
      from Opuntia ficus-indica, and standardized on lipophilic activity, was
      previously shown in preclinical and human studies to reduce dietary fat
      absorption through gastrointestinal (GI) fat binding. Here, we investigated the
      efficacy and safety of IQP G-002AS in body weight reduction. DESIGN AND METHODS: 
      One hundred twenty-five overweight and obese adults participated in the study.
      Subjects were advised on physical activity, and received nutritional counseling, 
      including hypocaloric diet plans (30% energy from fat and 500 kcal deficit/day). 
      After a 2-week placebo run-in phase, subjects were randomized to receive either 3
      g/day of IQP G-002AS (IQ) or a placebo. The primary endpoint was change in body
      weight from baseline; secondary endpoints included additional obesity measures
      and safety parameters. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-three subjects completed the
      12-week treatment phase (intention-to-treat (ITT) population: 30 male and 93
      female; mean BMI: 29.6 +/- 2.8 kg/m(2) and age: 45.4 +/- 11.3 years). The mean
      body weight change from baseline was 3.8 +/- 1.8 kg in IQ vs. 1.4 +/- 2.6 kg in
      placebo (P < 0.001). More IQ subjects lost at least 5% of their initial body
      weight compared to placebo (P = 0.027). Compared with placebo, IQ also showed
      significantly greater reduction in BMI, body fat composition, and waist
      circumference. IQ was well tolerated with no adverse reactions reported.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the natural fiber complex Litramine IQP
      G-002AS is effective in promoting weight loss.

TI  - Beware the BATUS Cactus--cactus dermatitis in exercising soldiers on the Albertan
      prairie.
PG  - 229-31
AB  - Species of the Opuntia or prickly pear genus of cacti are endemic to the British 
      Army Training Unit Suffield (BATUS) training area in Alberta, Canada. They are
      known to provoke a dermatitis reaction in harvesters of the cacti fruit. It's
      spines are frequently an uncomfortable nuisance to unwary soldiers exercising in 
      BATUS. We report two cases of particularly debilitating adverse skin reactions to
      the cacti spines that occurred during the 2010 Exercise Prairie Thunder season.

TI  - [Antileishmanial activity of six extracts from marine organisms].
PG  - 61-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: infections caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania are a global 
      health problem with a high prevalence in underdeveloped countries. There is no
      vaccine against this disease at present and the treatment used is poor, so the
      search for more effective and safe medicines is an urgent need. OBJECTIVE: to
      assess the in vitro antileishmanial activity of six aqueous and hydroalcohol
      extracts from marine organisms. METHODS: the activity of six extracts against
      Leishmania amazonensis promastigots and amastigots as well as their toxicity
      against peritoneal macrophages in BALB/c mice. RESULTS: in the promastigot assay,
      the extracts from Bryothamnion Iriquetrum, Bunodosoma granulifera, Halimeda
      opuntia and Physalia physalis showed growth inhibition at concentrations lower
      than 100 microg/mL whereas in amastigots, these last two extracts were the most
      active and least toxic with a selectivity index of 6 and 8 respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: taking these results into account, it was considered that the H.
      opuntia and P. physalis extracts showed a promising activity, so it is suggested 
      that further studies on its in vivo activity be conducted.

TI  - Chemopreventive effect of cactus (Opuntia humifusa) extracts: radical scavenging 
      activity, pro-apoptosis, and anti-inflammatory effect in human colon (SW480) and 
      breast cancer (MCF7) cells.
PG  - 681-8
LID - 10.1039/c3fo30287c [doi]
AB  - Cactus (Opuntia spp) is widely cultivated as a vegetable, fruit, and forage crop 
      and has been used in traditional medicine in American Indian, Mexican, and Korean
      cultures. Accumulative evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies using
      cacti suggests their biological and pharmacological activities, such as their
      anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory roles in different cancer cells. In this study,
      the Opuntia humifusa stem (OHS) was extracted with different solvents and
      screened for radical scavenging activity using
      2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS (+)) and
      1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH). In addition, the total phenolic and
      flavonoid contents of each extract were analyzed using the Folin-Ciocalteu method
      and high performance liquid chromatography, respectively. Further, the cacti's
      bioactive fractions were evaluated for cell cytotoxicity and to understand their 
      mechanism of action on human colon cancer (SW480) and breast cancer (MCF7) cells.
      An ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract exhibited the highest cytotoxicity and resulted 
      in an up-regulated expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax (bcl-2 associated 
      X protein) and a down-regulated expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 in 
      both SW480 and MCF7 cells. The apoptosis was mediated through activation of
      caspase 8, 9, and 3/7 activities as well as PARP cleavage in SW480 cells, while
      the same extract activated only a caspase 9 activity in MCF7 cells. Furthermore, 
      incubation of cells with the EtOAc extract down-regulated the expression of
      inflammatory molecules such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and inducible nitric oxide
      synthase (iNOS) in SW480 cells but not in MCF7 cells. Taken together, these
      results suggest that SW480 colon cancer cells are more susceptible to bioactive
      compounds present in OHS and may have potential in the prevention of cancer
      through modulation of apoptosis markers and inhibition of inflammatory pathways.

TI  - Thermal stability of selected natural red extracts used as food colorants.
PG  - 11-7
LID - 10.1007/s11130-013-0337-1 [doi]
AB  - The color degradation of aqueous solutions of six natural red pigment extracts
      (elderberry, red cabbage, hibiscus, red beet, Opuntia fruits and red cochineal)
      used commercially as food colorants was investigated at temperatures between 50
      and 90 degrees C. Color degradation was studied in respect to both spectral
      properties and visual color. The remaining absorbance at 535 nm as a function of 
      the incubation time and temperature was used to quantify the degradation process.
      Red cochineal was the most thermoresistant extract with a remaining absorbance of
      95 % after 6 h at 90 degrees C. Anthocyanin extracts (elderberry, red cabbage,
      hibiscus) showed remaining absorbance percentages of 63.8, 46.1 and 26.7,
      respectively. Betacyanin extracts (red beet, Opuntia fruits) were the most
      thermosensitive maintaining only 12.5 and 1.7 %, respectively, of the initial
      absorbance at 535 nm. Applying a first-order kinetic model to the degradation
      processes, reaction rate constants (k) and half-life periods (t 1/2 ) were
      calculated. The temperature dependence of the degradation rate constant obeyed
      the Arrhenius relationship, with activation energies (E a ) ranging between 3.02 
      and 53.37 kJ mol(-1). The higher activation energy values indicated greater
      temperature sensitivity. Changes in visual color attributes corroborated the high
      thermal stability of the red cochineal extract.

AB  - Natural selection and evolution develop a huge amount of biological materials in 
      different environments (e.g. lotus in water and opuntia in desert). These
      biological materials possess many inspiring properties, which hint scientists and
      engineers to find some useful clues to create new materials or update the
      existing ones. In this review, we highlight some well-studied (e.g. nacre shell) 
      and newly-studied (e.g. turtle shell) natural materials, and summarize their
      hierarchical structures and mechanisms behind their mechanical properties, from
      animals to plants. These fascinating mechanisms suggest to researchers to
      investigate natural materials deeply and broadly, and to design or fabricate new 
      bio-inspired materials to serve our life.

TI  - Reproductive response of fat-tailed Barbarine ewes subjected to short-term
      nutritional treatments including spineless cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica f.
      inermis) cladodes.
PG  - 43-9
LID - 10.1111/jpn.12028 [doi]
AB  - Reproductive outputs in fat-tailed Barbarine sheep in central Tunisia are often
      low because of feed shortage and the low nutritive value of diets.
      Supplementation with conventional concentrates is economically unsuitable in
      central Tunisia, so more cost-effective and sustainable alternative feeding
      strategies need to be developed. We tested effects of short-term nutritional
      treatments including cactus cladodes during the induction of 'male effect' on
      fertility and prolificacy parameters (follicular growth, ovulatory response and
      early embryo losses). One hundred and twenty ewes were distributed in 4 equal
      groups balanced for live weight grazed natural pastures and were supplemented for
      21 days, starting day 10 after introduction of rams, with cactus cladodes (CA),
      cactus cladodes and soybean meal (CAS), concentrate (CC) or only soybean meal
      (S). Nutritional treatment did not affect live weight in this experiment. Ewes
      receiving cactus had higher number of large pre-ovulatory follicles (>/=6 mm;
      1.08 +/- 0.05), between days 14 and 19 after introduction of rams, than females
      in the CC and S ewes (0.64 +/- 0.06; p < 0.05). However, there were no
      differences in the onset of oestrous behaviour in response to 'male effect' or in
      the number of corpora lutea. Average ovulation rates were 1.42 +/- 0.16 for CC,
      1.47 +/- 0.13 for CAS, 1.31 +/- 0.15 for CA and 1.31 +/- 0.13 for S groups
      respectively. Finally, reproductive wastages at day 35 after mating were not
      different between groups being 0.33 +/- 0.19 for CC, 0.60 +/- 0.17 for CAS, 0.43 
      +/- 0.16 for CA and 0.31 +/- 0.15 for S groups respectively. It is concluded that
      Barbarine ewes fed nutritional treatments including cactus performed similarly to

TI  - Comparative Study of Antioxidant Power, Polyphenols, Flavonoids and Betacyanins
      of the Peel and Pulp of Three Tunisian Opuntia Forms.
PG  - 37-51
LID - 10.3390/antiox2020037 [doi]
AB  - The antioxidant activity and the chemical composition of methanol extracts from
      peel and pulp belonging to two species of Tunisian prickly pears Opuntia ficus
      indica (spiny and thornless forms) and Opuntia stricta have been studied. The
      antioxidant capacity was measured by DPPH radical scavenging activity. The total 
      phenolic compound (TPC) and the total flavonoid content were determined by the
      Folin-Ciocalteu method and colorimetric method, respectively. The phenolic
      compounds were identified and quantified by high-performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) coupled with an electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
      (ESI-MS). The results showed that O. stricta fruits present the best antioxidant 
      activities than the two forms of O. ficus indica, while the TPC was more
      important in O. ficus indica than in the O. stricta fruits. The peels have higher
      flavonoids than pulp, and the thornless variety has more flavonoid than the
      spiny. The RP-HPLC and ESI-MS analysis detected two classes of phenolic compounds
      and betalain pigments. Isorhamnetin derivatives are the dominant flavonol
      glycoside identified in O. ficus indica (spiny: 65.25 mug.g(-1); thornless: 77.03
      mug.g(-1)) and O. stricta peels (19.22 mug.g(-1)).

TI  - Effect of different film packaging on microbial growth in minimally processed
      cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica).
PG  - 73-82
AB  - Microorganisms are natural contaminants of fresh produce and minimally processed 
      products, and contamination arises from a number of sources, including the
      environment, postharvest handling and processing. Fresh-cut products are
      particularly susceptible to microbial contaminations because of the changes
      occurring in the tissues during processing. In package gas composition of
      modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) in combination with low storage temperatures 
      besides reducing physiological activity of packaged produce, can also delay
      pathogen growth. Present study investigated on the effect of MAPs, achieved with 
      different plastic films, on microbial growth of minimally processed cactus pear
      (Opuntio ficus-indica) fruit. Five different plastic materials were used for
      packaging the manually peeled fruit. That is: a) polypropylene film (Termoplast
      MY 40 micron thickness, O2 transmission rate 300 cc/m2/24h); b) polyethylene film
      (Bolphane BHE, 11 micron thickness, O2 transmission rate 19000 cc/m2/24h); c)
      polypropylene laser-perforated films (Mach Packaging) with 8, 16 or 32 100-micron
      holes. Total aerobic psychrophilic, mesophilic microorganisms,
      Enterobacteriaceae, yeast, mould populations and in-package CO2, O2 and C2H4 were
      determined at each storage time. Different final gas compositions, ranging from
      7.8 KPa to 17.1 KPa O2, and 12.7 KPa to 2.6 KPa CO2, were achieved with MY and
      micro perforated films, respectively. Differences were detected in the
      mesophilic, Enterobacteriaceae and yeast loads, while no difference was detected 
      in psychrophilic microorganisms. At the end of storage, microbial load in fruits 
      sealed with MY film was significantly lower than in those sealed with BHE and
      micro perforated films. Furthermore, fruits packed with micro-perforated films
      showed the highest microbial load. This occurrence may in part be related to
      in-package gas composition and in part to a continuous contamination of
      microorganisms through micro-holes.

TI  - Evaluation of the suspending properties of two local Opuntia spp. mucilages on
      paracetamol suspension.
PG  - 23-9
AB  - Some excipients are currently available for the formulation of pharmaceutical
      suspensions. The purpose of this study is to develop cheap and effective natural 
      excipient that can be used as an effective alternative for the formulation of
      pharmaceutical suspensions. The suspending properties of Opuntia ficus-indica and
      Opuntia stricta mucilages (family Cactaceae) were evaluated comparatively with
      that of NaCMC at concentration range of 2-6% (w/v) in Paracetamol suspension.
      Sedimentation volume (%) (with and without electrolyte), rheology,
      redispersibility, and dissolution rate of the suspensions were employed as
      evaluation parameters. The values obtained were used as basis for comparison of
      the suspending agents. The apparent viscosities of the suspensions in all the
      suspending agents concentration levels and applied shear rates were in the order 
      of NaCMC>OS>OFI with non-Newtonian flow and accordingly the flow rates of the
      suspensions were in the order of OFI > OS > NaCMC. The sedimentation volumes (%) 
      of the suspensions in all the suspending agent concentration levels were higher
      for OS followed by OFI and then NaCMC. The high sedimentation volumes (%) of
      suspensions, in turn, were accompanied by ease of redispersibility of that order.
      The effect of electrolyte on sedimentation volume (%) had dual effect. It was
      only the suspensions that had NaCMC that showed increase in sedimentation volume 
      (%) in all molar NaCl concentration. However, in suspensions that had mucilages
      of OS and OFI, an initial increase in sediment volumes (%) were accompanied by
      decrease after 1x10(-3)M and 1x10(-2)M of NaCl, respectively. Dissolution of the 
      suspensions which had mucilages attained the acceptable ranges (> 80% drug
      release in 30 min) in 5 min. Similarly, except A6 formulations A2, A3, A4 and A5 
      have attained the limit but the release was not as quick as the previous
      formulations. Hence, it can be concluded that mucilages of Opuntia spp. (Opuntia 
      ficus-indica and Opuntia stricta) can be used as alternatives to NaCMC as
      suspending agent in suspension formulations.

TI  - Phytochemical indicaxanthin suppresses 7-ketocholesterol-induced THP-1 cell
      apoptosis by preventing cytosolic Ca(2+) increase and oxidative stress.
PG  - 230-40
LID - 10.1017/S000711451200493X [doi]
AB  - 7-Ketocholesterol (7-KC)-induced apoptosis of macrophages is considered a key
      event in the development of human atheromas. In the present study, the effect of 
      indicaxanthin (Ind), a bioactive pigment from cactus pear fruit, on 7-KC-induced 
      apoptosis of human monocyte/macrophage THP-1 cells was investigated. A
      pathophysiological condition was simulated by using amounts of 7-KC that can be
      reached in human atheromatous plaque. Ind was assayed within a micromolar
      concentration range, consistent with its plasma level after dietary
      supplementation with cactus pear fruit. Pro-apoptotic effects of 7-KC were
      assessed by cell cycle arrest, exposure of phosphatidylserine at the plasma
      membrane, variation of nuclear morphology, decrease of mitochondrial
      trans-membrane potential, activation of Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death and
      poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 cleavage. Kinetic measurements within 24 h showed
      early formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species over basal levels,
      preceding NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX-4) over-expression and elevation of cytosolic
      Ca(2)(+), with progressive depletion of total thiols. 7-KC-dependent activation
      of the redox-sensitive NF-kappaB was observed. Co-incubation of 2.5 mum of Ind
      completely prevented 7-KC-induced pro-apoptotic events. The effects of Ind may be
      ascribed to inhibition of NOX-4 basal activity and over-expression, inhibition of
      NF-kappaB activation, maintaining cell redox balance and Ca homeostasis, with
      prevention of mitochondrial damage and consequently apoptosis. The findings
      suggest that Ind, a highly bioavailable dietary phytochemical, may exert
      protective effects against atherogenetic toxicity of 7-KC at a concentration of
      nutritional interest.

AB  - Multiple biological structures have demonstrated fog collection abilities, such
      as beetle backs with bumps and spider silks with periodic spindle-knots and
      joints. Many Cactaceae species live in arid environments and are extremely
      drought-tolerant. Here we report that one of the survival systems of the cactus
      Opuntia microdasys lies in its efficient fog collection system. This unique
      system is composed of well-distributed clusters of conical spines and trichomes
      on the cactus stem; each spine contains three integrated parts that have
      different roles in the fog collection process according to their surface
      structural features. The gradient of the Laplace pressure, the gradient of the
      surface-free energy and multi-function integration endow the cactus with an
      efficient fog collection system. Investigations of the structure-function
      relationship in this system may help us to design novel materials and devices to 
      collect water from fog with high efficiencies.

TI  - Development of a configurable growth chamber with a computer vision system to
      study circadian rhythm in plants.
PG  - 15356-75
LID - 10.3390/s121115356 [doi]
AB  - Plant development is the result of an endogenous morphogenetic program that
      integrates environmental signals. The so-called circadian clock is a set of genes
      that integrates environmental inputs into an internal pacing system that gates
      growth and other outputs. Study of circadian growth responses requires high
      sampling rates to detect changes in growth and avoid aliasing. We have developed 
      a flexible configurable growth chamber comprising a computer vision system that
      allows sampling rates ranging between one image per 30 s to hours/days. The
      vision system has a controlled illumination system, which allows the user to set 
      up different configurations. The illumination system used emits a combination of 
      wavelengths ensuring the optimal growth of species under analysis. In order to
      obtain high contrast of captured images, the capture system is composed of two
      CCD cameras, for day and night periods. Depending on the sample type, a flexible 
      image processing software calculates different parameters based on geometric
      calculations. As a proof of concept we tested the system in three different plant
      tissues, growth of petunia- and snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) flowers and of
      cladodes from the cactus Opuntia ficus-indica. We found that petunia flowers grow
      at a steady pace and display a strong growth increase in the early morning,
      whereas Opuntia cladode growth turned out not to follow a circadian growth
      pattern under the growth conditions imposed. Furthermore we were able to identify
      a decoupling of increase in area and length indicating that two independent
      growth processes are responsible for the final size and shape of the cladode.

AB  - The essential oils composition of the skin, pulp and seeds from fruits of two
      Sicilian cultivars of Opuntia ficus-indica (cv. Sanguigna and cv. Surfarina) has 
      been obtained by hydrodistillation and the possible antioxidant, antimicrobial
      and semiochemical roles have been investigated comparing the data with those
      reported in the literature. The presence of antioxidants and antimicrobials found
      in this study increases the spectrum of compounds that have beneficial properties
      in O. ficus-indica. In addition, several compounds identified in this study have 
      been reported to influence the behaviour of Ceratitis capitata, a phytophagous
      pest which causes severe damages to several crops including O. ficus-indica and
      the kairomonal activity of the odour of the fruits seems provided by a blend of
      compounds found in the various matrices analysed.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of Opuntia humifusa on 7, 12-dimethyl- benz[a]anthracene and
      12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate induced two-stage skin carcinogenesis.
PG  - 4655-60
AB  - Opuntia humifusa, member of the Cactaceae family, was previously demonstrated to 
      have radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects in in
      vitro models. It was suggested that O. humifusa could function in the prevention 
      of carcinogenesis. To investigate the in vivo chemopreventive effect of O.
      humifusa, mice were fed a diet containing either 1% or 3% following 7,
      12-dimethylbenz[a] anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
      (TPA) induction of skin carcinogenesis. Significant decrease in the numbers of
      papilloma and epidermal hyperplasia were observed in mice fed with O. humifusa,
      compared to the control group. O. humifusa also upregulated high total
      antioxidant capacity and level of phase II detoxifying enzyme such as superoxide 
      dismutase and glutathione S-transferase activity in the skin. Lipid peroxidation 
      activity level was measured in skin cytosol and significantly inhibited in 3% OH 
      fed group compared to the control group. These results suggest that O. humifusa
      exerts chemopreventive effects on chemical carcinogenesis in mouse skin and that 
      prevention effects are associated with reduction of oxidative stress via the
      modulation of cutaneous lipid peroxidation, enhancing of total antioxidant
      capacity especially in phase II detoxifying enzyme system and partial apoptotic
      influence.

AB  - The marine fungus Aspergillus versicolor was isolated from the inner tissue of
      the Red Sea green alga Halimeda opuntia. The fungus was identified by its
      morphology and 18s rDNA. Cultivation of this fungal strain led to a new
      metabolite named isorhodoptilometrin-1-methyl ether (1) along with the known
      compounds emodin (2), 1-methyl emodin (3), evariquinone (4), 7-hydroxyemodin
      6,8-methyl ether (5), siderin (6), arugosin C (7), and variculanol (8). The
      structures were elucidated on the basis of NMR spectroscopic analysis and mass
      spectrometry. The biological properties of ethyl acetate extract and compounds
      1-3 and 6-8 were explored for antimicrobial activity, anti-cancer activity and
      inhibition of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease.

TI  - Antihyperlipidemic effect of methanolic extract from Opuntia joconostle seeds in 
      mice fed a hypercholesterolemic diet.
PG  - 365-70

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypolipidemic effect of a
      methanolic extract from Opuntia joconostle seeds fed to mice in a
      hypercholesterolemic diet. Acute toxicity of the methanolic extract was
      investigated by an established method. Phenolic composition and antioxidant
      activity were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and DPPH,
      respectively. The total phenolic content of Opuntia joconostle seeds was 47.85
      +/- 1.29 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight. The main phenolic compounds
      were identified as quercetin, rutin, and cafeic acid. Percent inhibition of
      DPPH(+) was 49.76 +/- 0.49 %. The oral LD(5)(0) for the methanolic extract from
      the Opuntia joconostle seeds was >5,000 mg/kg BW. Mice fed a hypercholesterolemic
      diet for six days exhibited significantly (P </= 0.001) higher plasma lipid
      levels than mice fed a normal diet. Remarkably, supplementation with methanolic
      extract from Opuntia joconostle at doses of 1, 2, and 5 g/kg body weight
      significantly (P </= 0.001) prevented the increase in total cholesterol,
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides level, and atherogenic index. 
      Similar concentrations of the HDL cholesterol were observed in both treated and
      control groups. A significant dose-dependent reduction in lipid levels was noted 
      for treated groups compared to the hypercholesterolemic group. We attribute this 
      result to the seeds' phenolic composition. This methanolic extract has potential 
      to be included in short-term hypercholesterolemia treatment regimens as it
      exhibits hypolipidemic activity with no apparent toxic manifestations.

AB  - The antihyperlipidaemic effects of ODP-Ia, one of the main components of Opuntia 
      dillenii Haw. polysaccharides, were studied. Gavage administration of ODP-Ia was 
      observed to significantly decrease serum lipid levels and to increase serum
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in hyperlipidaemic rats. Similar
      suppressive patterns were also seen in hepatic total cholesterol and triglyceride
      levels. Moreover, the ODP-Ia administration significantly increased serum
      lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity, increased the production of serum 
      NO, inhibited hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity, augmented serum and hepatic
      superoxide dismutase activities and decreased the serum and hepatic
      malondialdehyde contents in hyperlipidaemic rats. In addition, a
      histopathological examination revealed that ODP-Ia administration significantly
      suppressed inflammatory cell infiltration and the expression of VCAM-1. Together,
      these results indicate that ODP-Ia is a potential natural product for the
      treatment of hyperlipidaemia-related diseases by improving antioxidant levels,
      modulating the activities of enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism,
      promoting the production of NO and suppressing the expression of VCAM-1, thereby 
      suppressing lipid accumulation and inflammatory cell infiltration.

PG  - 337-43
LID - 10.1007/s11130-012-0316-y [doi]
AB  - Mature cactus pears from Opuntia stricta have a dark purple color due to high
      betacyanin concentration, whose biosynthesis is initiated with the amino acid
      L-tyrosine as a primary precursor. This study followed the maturation and
      ripening processes of Opuntia stricta fruits to harvest them at high betacyanin
      and other antioxidant concentrations. Fruits lasted 9 months for final ripening. 
      Physical and compositional changes at different maturation and ripening stages
      have been determined. Thus, ripe fruits were around 4.72 +/- 0.10 cm length, 2.94
      +/- 0.05 cm diameter and 22.71 +/- 0.20 g weight; moisture and pH were maintained
      at 87.05 +/- 0.19 % and 3.37 +/- 0.12, respectively. Purple pigment production
      started in the ovary of immature fruits four months after anthesis (MAA).
      Concentration of all analyzed metabolites increased from immature (4 MAA) until
      ripe (9 MAA) stage. In ripe fruits, reducing sugars were 4.72 +/- 0.54 g/100 g ff
      and total phenols 135.17 +/- 0.68 mg gallic acid/100 g ff. Metabolites identified
      by HPLC were the betacyanins: betanin (60.17 +/- 1.08 mg/100 g ff), isobetanin
      (7.58 +/- 0.94 mg/100 g ff) and betanidin (13.48 +/- 0.87 mg/100 g ff). Also,
      L-ascorbic acid (35.03 +/- 1.06 mg/100 g ff) and L-tyrosine (4.43 +/- 0.73 mg/100
      g ff) were determined. Furthermore, the addition of L-tyrosine or L-dopa to fruit
      pulp of moderately ripe fruits, increased betacyanin concentrations 17 (103.3 +/-
      3.8 mg/100 g) and 32 % (114.3 +/- 4.1 mg/100 g), respectively.

LID - 10.1089/jmf.2012.2282 [doi]
AB  - The protective activity of prickly pear cactus (Opuntia ficus indica var.
      saboten) fruit juice and its main constituent, betanin, were evaluated against
      stress-induced acute gastric lesions in rats. After 6 h of water immersion
      restraint stress (WIRS), gastric mucosal lesions with bleeding were induced in
      Sprague-Dawley rats. Pretreatment of a lyophilized powder containing O. ficus
      indica var. saboten fruit juice and maltodextrin (OFSM) and betanin significantly
      reduced stress lesions (800-1600 mg/kg). Both OFSM and betanin effectively
      prevented the decrease in gastric mucus content as detected by alcian blue
      staining. In addition, OFSM significantly suppressed WIRS-induced increases in
      the level of gastric mucosal tumor necrosis factor-alpha and myeloperoxidase
      (MPO). Betanin alone was only effective in decreasing MPO. These results revealed
      the protective activity of OFSM against stress-induced acute gastric lesions and 
      that betanin may contribute to OFSM's gastric protective activity, at least in
      part. When OFSM and betanin were taken together, OFSM exerted gastroprotective
      activity against stress-induced gastric lesions by maintaining gastric mucus,
      which might be related to the attenuation of MPO-mediated damage and
      proinflammatory cytokine production.

AB  - The aim of our present study is to investigate the effect of Opuntia ficus indica
      f. inermis prickly pear juice (PPJ) against ethanol-induced liver injury in rats.
      Chronic ethanol administration (3 g/kg b.w.) during 90 days to Wistar rats,
      significantly (p < 0.01) increased the liver lipid and protein oxidation, reduced
      the glutathione content and the activities of liver antioxidant enzymes such as
      superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and conversely elevated
      the liver injury biochemical markers like aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
      aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase, lactate
      dehydrogenase, cholesterol, triglycerides and caused a severe histopathologic
      injuries. Conversely pre-treatment of ethanol-fed rats with PPJ (20 and 40 ml/kg 
      b.w., orally), interestingly reduced liver lipid and protein oxidation,
      histopathologic lesions and inhibited the alterations of antioxidant enzymes and 
      the release of biochemical markers. The hepatoprotective effect of PPJ could be
      due to their capacity to end free radicals chain reactions or to enhance the
      endogenous antioxidants activities.

AB  - In order to reduce the impact of nitrogen pollution and to increase the agronomic
      value of plant wastes to be reused as organic fertilizer, we have investigated
      the removal of ammonium from aqueous solutions onto cactus leave fibers (CLF),
      and the mechanisms involved in the retention of ammonium at CLF surface. The
      results showed that ammonium retention onto these fibers occurred for a wide pH
      (6-10) and temperature ranges (20-60 degrees C) and the biosorption potential of 
      CLF increased with temperature from 1.4 to 2.3 mg g(-1) for initial concentration
      of 50 mg L(-1). The modeling studies showed that the ammonium biosorption was
      well described by the pseudo-second-order model, predicting therefore,
      chemisorption interactions-type at earlier stages and by intraparticle diffusion 
      at later stages. Biosorption is governed by film diffusion process at higher
      concentrations and by particle diffusion process at higher temperatures. The
      surface of CLF determined by SEM revealed the presence of cracks and cavities
      which may allow the intraparticle diffusion and the ion exchange processes.
      Moreover, FTIR and EDX analysis before and after ammonium retention showed that
      the main mechanisms involved in the removal of ammonium were the ionic exchange
      by calcium ions as well as H(+) and the complexation with carboxylic, alcoholic
      and phenolic groups.

TI  - Opuntia ficus indica (nopal) attenuates hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress in
      obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats.
PG  - 1956-63
LID - 10.3945/jn.112.165563 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with multiple factors such
      as obesity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. Nopal, a cactus plant
      widely consumed in the Mexican diet, is considered a functional food because of
      its antioxidant activity and ability to improve biomarkers of metabolic syndrome.
      The aim of this study was to assess the effect of nopal consumption on the
      development of hepatic steatosis and hepatic oxidative stress and on the
      regulation of genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. Obese Zucker (fa/fa)
      rats were fed a control diet or a diet containing 4% nopal for 7 wk. Rats fed the
      nopal-containing diet had approximately 50% lower hepatic TG than the control
      group as well as a reduction in hepatomegaly and biomarkers of hepatocyte injury 
      such as alanine and aspartate aminotransferases. Attenuation of hepatic steatosis
      by nopal consumption was accompanied by a higher serum concentration of
      adiponectin and a greater abundance of mRNA for genes involved in lipid oxidation
      and lipid export and production of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and
      microsomal TG transfer proteins in liver. Hepatic reactive oxygen species and
      lipid peroxidation biomarkers were significantly lower in rats fed nopal compared
      with the control rats. Furthermore, rats fed the nopal diet had a lower
      postprandial serum insulin concentration and a greater liver phosphorylated
      protein kinase B (pAKT):AKT ratio in the postprandial state. This study suggests 
      that nopal consumption attenuates hepatic steatosis by increasing fatty acid
      oxidation and VLDL synthesis, decreasing oxidative stress, and improving liver
      insulin signaling in obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats.

LID - 10.3390/ijms130810154 [doi]
AB  - Abiotic stress limits seed germination, plant growth, flowering and fruit
      quality, causing economic decrease. Small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSPs) are
      chaperons with roles in stress tolerance. Herein, we report the functional
      characterization of a cytosolic class CI sHSP (OpsHSP18) from Opuntia
      streptacantha during seed germination in Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic lines
      subjected to different stress and hormone treatments. The over-expression of the 
      OpsHSP18 gene in A. thaliana increased the seed germination rate under salt
      (NaCl) and osmotic (glucose and mannitol) stress, and in ABA treatments, compared
      with WT. On the other hand, the over-expression of the OpsHSP18 gene enhanced
      tolerance to salt (150 mM NaCl) and osmotic (274 mM mannitol) stress in
      Arabidopsis seedlings treated during 14 and 21 days, respectively. These plants
      showed increased survival rates (52.00 and 73.33%, respectively) with respect to 
      the WT (18.75 and 53.75%, respectively). Thus, our results show that OpsHSP18
      gene might have an important role in abiotic stress tolerance, in particular in
      seed germination and survival rate of Arabidopsis plants under unfavorable
      conditions.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of
      xoconostle pears (Opuntia matudae) against Escherichia coli O157:H7. Xoconostle
      pears were sliced, blended, and centrifuged. The supernatant was then filtered
      using a 0.45 mum filter to obtain direct extract. Direct extract of xoconostle
      pears was tested against four strains of E. coli O157:H7 in brain heart infusion 
      (BHI) laboratory medium using growth over time and agar well diffusion assays.
      Our results showed that direct extract of xoconostle pears had a significant (P <
      0.05) inhibitory effect at 4, 6, and 8% (v/v) concentrations and complete
      inhibitory effect at 10% (v/v) during 8 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. Minimum 
      inhibitory volume (MIV) was 400 muL mL(-1) (v/v) and minimum lethal volume (MLV) 
      was 650 muL mL(-1) (v/v). The inhibitory effect of xoconostle pears found to be
      concentration dependent and not strain dependent. Thus, xoconostle pears extract 
      has the potential to inhibit the growth of E. coli O157:H7 and could provide a
      natural means of controlling pathogenic contamination, thereby mitigating food
      safety risks.

TI  - Trace element mobility and transfer to vegetation within the Ethiopian Rift
      Valley lake areas.
PG  - 2698-709
AB  - To evaluate critical trace element loads in native vegetation and calculate
      soil-to-plant transfer factors (TFs), 11 trace elements (Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, 
      Se, Mo, Cd, Pb and Mn) have been determined in leaves of 9 taxonomically verified
      naturally growing terrestrial plant species as well as in soil samples collected 
      around 3 Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes (Koka, Ziway and Awassa). The Cr
      concentration in leaves of all the plant species was higher than the "normal"
      range, with the highest level (8.4 mg per kg dw) being observed in Acacia
      tortilis from the Lake Koka area. Caper species (Capparis fascicularis) and
      Ethiopian dogstooth grass (Cynodon aethiopicus) from Koka also contained
      exceptionally high levels of Cd (1 mg per kg dw) and Mo (32.8 mg per kg dw),
      respectively. Pb, As and Cu concentrations were low in the plant leaves from all 
      sites. The low Cu level in important fodder plant species (Cynodon aethiopicus,
      Acacia tortilis and Opuntia ficus-indicus) implies potential deficiency in
      grazing and browsing animals. Compared to the Canadian environmental quality
      guideline and maximum allowable concentration in agricultural soils, the total
      soil trace element concentrations at the studied sites are safe for agricultural 
      crop production. Enrichment factor was high for Zn in soils around Lakes Ziway
      and Awassa, resulting in moderate to high transfer of Zn to the studied plants. A
      six step sequential extraction procedure on the soils revealed a relatively high 
      mobility of Cd, Se and Mn. Strong association of most trace elements with the
      redox sensitive fraction and mineral lattice was also confirmed by partial
      redundancy analysis. TF (mg per kg dw plants/mg per kg dw soil) values based on
      the total (TF(total)) and mobile fractions (TF(mobile)) of soil trace element
      concentrations varied widely among elements and plant species, with the averaged 
      TF(total) and TF(mobile) values ranging from 0.01-2 and 1-60, respectively.
      Considering the mobile fraction in soils should be available to plants,
      TF(mobile) values could reflect trace elements transfer to plants in the most
      realistic way. However, the present study indicates that TF(total) values also
      reflect the transfer of elements such as Mn, Cd and Se to plants more
      realistically than TF(mobile) values did.

      nopalito and cactus pear fruit (Opuntia spp.).
PG  - 1599-610
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.201200047 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to quantify mucilages, pectins, hemicelluloses, and
      cellulose of nopalitos (edible, as vegetable, young cladodes of flat-stemmed
      spiny cacti) of most consumed Mexican cultivars, and sweet and acid cactus pear
      fruits of Opuntia spp. The hypothesis is that, regardless of their unavailable
      polysaccharides diversity, nopalitos and cactus pear fruits are rich sources of
      soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. Twelve cultivars of Opuntia spp. were used. 
      Nopalitos had a significant variation in structural polysaccharides among the
      cultivars: mucilages (from 3.8 to 8.6% dry matter (DM)) averaged near a half of
      pectins content (from 6.1 to 14.2% DM) and tightly bound hemicelluloses (from 2.2
      to 4.7% DM), which were the less abundant polysaccharides, amounted 50% of the
      loosely bound hemicelluloses (from 4.3 to 10.7% DM). Acid fruits (or
      'xoconostle') had significantly higher unavailable polysaccharides content than
      sweet fruit, and contain similar proportions than nopalitos. Unavailable
      polysaccharides represent a high proportion of dry tissues of nopalitos and
      cactus pear fruits, composition of both of these soluble and insoluble
      polysaccharides (total dietary fiber) widely vary among cultivars without an
      evident pattern. Nopalitos and cactus pear fruit can be considered an excellent
      source of dietary fiber.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine some mineral contents of prickly pear
      (Opuntia ficus-indica L.) seeds collected from different locations. The mineral
      contents of seeds were established by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission 
      spectrometry. All the seeds contained Ca, K, Mg and P at high levels. Calcium
      content ranged between 268.5 (sample no. 11) and 674.8 ppm (sample no. 4). The
      level of K changed between 346.7 (sample no. 1) and 676.1 ppm (sample no. 13).
      Phosphorus content of seeds varied between 1,173.6 (sample no. 14) and 1,871.3
      ppm (sample no. 1). It is apparent that seeds are good sources of the macro and
      micro minerals and can be consumed as a food ingredient to provide nutrition.

AB  - We investigated the effect of Opuntia humifusa (O. humifusa) supplementation on
      bone density and related hormone secretion in growing male rats. Sixteen
      six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups;
      control diet group (CG, n = 8), and experimental diet group (EG, n = 8). The rats
      in the CG were given a control diet and those in the EG were given 5% O. humifusa
      added to the control diet for eight weeks. The serum OC level of the EG was
      significantly higher than that of the CG, and the serum parathyroid hormone (PTH)
      level of EG was significantly lower than that of the CG. In addition, the femoral
      and tibial BMD of the EG were significantly higher values than those of the CG,
      and the tibial BMC of the EG was significantly higher than that of the CG. These 
      results suggest that O. humifusa supplementation has a positive effect on bone
      density by suppressing PTH and increasing the OC level in growing male rats.

TI  - Trans-epithelial transport of the betalain pigments indicaxanthin and betanin
      across Caco-2 cell monolayers and influence of food matrix.
PG  - 1077-87
LID - 10.1007/s00394-012-0414-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigated the absorption mechanism of the phytochemicals
      indicaxanthin and betanin and the influence of their food matrix (cactus pear and
      red beet) on the intestinal transport. METHODS: Trans-epithelial transport of
      dietary-consistent amounts of indicaxanthin and betanin in Caco-2 cell monolayers
      seeded on Transwell(R) inserts was measured in apical to basolateral (AP-BL) and 
      basolateral to apical (BL-AP) direction, under an inwardly directed pH gradient
      (pH 6.0/7.4, AP/BL) mimicking luminal and serosal sides of human intestinal
      epithelium. The effect of inhibitors of membrane transporters on the absorption
      was also evaluated. Contribution of the paracellular route was investigated after
      EDTA treatment of the cell monolayer. In vitro digestion of betalainic food was
      performed to provide a post-intestinal fraction containing bioaccessible
      pigments. RESULTS: Apparent permeability coefficients (P(app)) in the absorptive 
      direction were (4.4 +/- 0.4) x 10(-)(6) and (3.2 +/- 0.3) x 10(-)(6) cm s(-)(1)
      for indicaxanthin and betanin, respectively. Transport of indicaxanthin was
      non-polarized, linear as a function of time and concentration, and unaffected by 
      inhibitors of membrane transporters. Betanin exhibited significantly different
      bidirectional P(app) values and non-linear efflux kinetics. The
      concentration-dependent betanin efflux was described by a kinetic model including
      one non-saturable (K(d) = 0.042 muL cm(-)(2) min(-)(1)) and one saturable
      component identified as the apical multidrug resistance-associated protein 2
      (MRP2; K(m) = 275 muM; J(max) = 42 pmol min(-)(1) cm(-)(2)). Permeation of both
      betalains increased remarkably after EDTA treatment of the cell monolayer.
      Neither indicaxanthin nor betanin underwent metabolic transformation. Food matrix
      did not affect trans-epithelial transfer of indicaxanthin, but reduced the
      absorption rate of betanin, red beet more than cactus pear. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary 
      indicaxanthin and betanin can substantially be absorbed through paracellular
      junctions of intestinal epithelial cells. Additional trans-membrane permeation
      can be considered for betanin, whose absorption is limited by a MRP2-mediated
      efflux and negatively affected by its food matrix. Present findings are
      consistent with the quite higher bioavailability of indicaxanthin over betanin
      established in humans.

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica Mill. (forage cactus) is farmed with relative success in the
      semi-arid region of the Brazilian northeast for commercial purposes, particularly
      as forage and food. Endophytic microorganisms are those that can be isolated
      inside plant tissues and can be a new source to production of enzymes with
      different potentialities. The objective of this study was to describe the
      richness of endophytic fungi from O. ficus-indica and to detect the capacity of
      these species to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. Forty-four endophytic 
      fungi species were isolated. Among them, the most commonly found were
      Cladosporium cladosporioides (20.43%) and C. sphaerospermum (15.99%). Acremonium 
      terricola, Monodictys castaneae, Penicillium glandicola, Phoma tropica and
      Tetraploa aristata are being reported for the first time as endophytic fungi for 
      Brazil. The majority of isolated fungi exhibited enzymatic potential. Aspergillus
      japonicus and P. glandicola presented pectinolytic activity. Xylaria sp. was the 
      most important among the other 14 species with positive cellulase activity. All
      24 isolates analysed were xylanase-positive. Protease was best produced by
      isolate PF103. The results indicate that there is a significant richness of
      endophytic fungi in O. ficus-indica, and that these isolates indicate promising
      potential for deployment in biotechnological processes involving production of
      pectinases, cellulases, xylanases and proteases.

TI  - Opuntia ficus-indica ingestion stimulates peripheral disposal of oral glucose
      before and after exercise in healthy men.
PG  - 284-91
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Opuntia ficus-indica
      (OFI) cladode and fruit-skin extract on blood glucose and plasma insulin
      increments due to high-dose carbohydrate ingestion, before and after exercise.
      Healthy, physically active men (n = 6; 21.0 +/- 1.6 years, 78.1 +/- 6.0 kg)
      participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study involving 2
      experimental sessions. In each session, the subjects successively underwent an
      oral glucose tolerance test at rest (OGTT(R)), a 30-min cycling bout at ~75%
      VO(2max), and another OGTT after exercise (OGTT(EX)). They received capsules
      containing either 1,000 mg OFI or placebo (PL) 30 min before and immediately
      after the OGTT(R). Blood samples were collected before (t(0)) and at 30-min
      intervals after ingestion of 75 g glucose for determination of blood glucose and 
      serum insulin. In OGTT(EX) an additional 75-g oral glucose bolus was administered
      at t(6)(0). In OGTT(R), OFI administration reduced the area under the glucose
      curve (AUC(GLUC)) by 26%, mainly due to lower blood glucose levels at t(3)(0) and
      t(6)(0) (p < .05). Furthermore, a higher serum insulin concentration was noted
      after OFI intake at baseline and at t(3)(0) (p < .05). In OGTT(EX), blood glucose
      at t(6)(0) was ~10% lower in OFI than in PL, which resulted in a decreased
      AUC(GLUC) (-37%, p < .05). However, insulin values and AUC(INS) were not
      different between OFI and PL. In conclusion, the current study shows that OFI
      extract can increase plasma insulin and thereby facilitate the clearance of an
      oral glucose load from the circulation at rest and after endurance exercise in
      healthy men.

TI  - Supercritical SC-CO(2) and Soxhlet n-Hexane Extract of Tunisian Opuntia ficus
      indica Seeds and Fatty Acids Analysis.
PG  - 914693
LID - 10.1155/2012/914693 [doi]
AB  - The fatty acids profiles of Tunisian Opuntia ficus indica seeds (spiny and
      thornless form) were investigated. Results of supercritical carbon dioxide
      (SC-CO(2)) and soxhlet n-hexane extract were compared. Quantitatively, the better
      yield was obtained through soxhlet n-hexane: 10.32% (spiny) and 8.91% (thornless)
      against 3.4% (spiny) and 1.94% (thornless) by SC-CO(2) extract (T = 40 degrees C,
      P = 180 bar, time = 135 mn, CO(2) flow rate = 15 mL.s(-1)). Qualitatively, the
      main fatty acids components were the same for the two types of extraction.
      Linoleic acid was the major compound, SC-CO(2): 57.60% (spiny), 59.98%
      (thornless), soxhlet n-hexane: 57.54% (spiny), 60.66% (thornless), followed by
      oleic acid, SC-CO(2): 22.31% (spiny), 22.40% (thornless), soxhlet n-hexane:
      25.28% (spiny), 20.58% (thornless) and palmitic acid, SC-CO(2): 14.3% (spiny),
      12.92% (thornless), soxhlet n-hexane: 11.33% (spiny), 13.08% (thornless). The
      SC-CO(2) profiles fatty acids showed a richness with other minority compounds
      such as C(20:1), C(20:2), and C(22).The seeds oil was highly unsaturated (US =
      4.44-5.25), and the rising temperatures donot affect the selectivity of fatty
      acids extract by SC-CO2: US = 4.44 (T = 40 degrees C) and 4.13 (T = 70 degrees
      C).

TI  - Chemical cues influence pupation behavior of Drosophila simulans and Drosophila
      buzzatii in nature and in the laboratory.
PG  - e39393
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0039393 [doi]
AB  - In the wild, larvae of several species of Drosophila develop in heterogeneous and
      rapidly changing environments sharing resources as food and space. In this
      scenario, sensory systems contribute to detect, localize and recognize congeners 
      and heterospecifics, and provide information about the availability of food and
      chemical features of environments where animals live. We investigated the
      behavior of D. simulans and D. buzzatii larvae to chemicals emitted by
      conspecific and heterospecific larvae. Our goal was to understand the role of
      these substances in the selection of pupation sites in the two species that
      cohabit within decaying prickly pear fruits (Opuntia ficus-indica). In these
      breeding sites, larvae of D. simulans and D. buzzatii detect larvae of the other 
      species changing their pupation site preferences. Larvae of the two species
      pupated in the part of the fruit containing no or few heterospecifics, and spent 
      a longer time in/on spots marked by conspecifics rather than heterospecifics. In 
      contrast, larvae of the two species reared in isolation from conspecifics pupated
      randomly over the substrate and spent a similar amount of time on spots marked by
      conspecifics and by heterospecifics. Our results indicate that early
      chemically-based experience with conspecific larvae is critical for the selection
      of the pupation sites in D. simulans and D. buzzatii, and that pupation site
      preferences of Drosophila larvae depend on species-specific chemical cues. These 
      preferences can be modulate by the presence of larvae of the same or another
      species.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate specific immune modulation of Opuntia dillenii
      polysaccharides (ODPs) on mice (body fluid and cells). METHODS: An
      immunosuppressed murine model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of
      cyclophosphamide (Cy, ip). The intraserous hemolysin IgM, IgG levels, the
      proliferation of spenocytes and the proportion of T lymphocyte subsets in
      peripheral blood were determined after the mice treated by ODPs. Proliferative
      effects of ODP-I, the main component purified from ODPs, on the lymphocytes in
      vitro were also studied. RESULTS: ODPs could significantly increase intraserous
      IgM and IgG levels, significantly enhance the proliferation of T and B
      lymphocytes and restore them to normal level. ODPs significantly reduced the
      percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes subset, therefore significantly reduced the
      proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes of peripheral blood from
      immunosuppressive mice and restored it to normal level. ODP-I significantly
      enhanced the natural proliferation of splenic lymphocyte and assisted the
      proliferation of T and B lymphocytes which induced by mitogen ConA or LPS.
      CONCLUSION: ODPs can enhance the specific immune function of immunosuppressed
      mice and the proliferation of lymphocytes in vitro.

AB  - Exposure to TEX-OE(R), a patented extract of the prickly pear cactus (Opuntia
      ficus indica) containing chaperone-stimulating factor, was shown to protect
      common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., fingerlings against acute ammonia stress.
      Survival was enhanced twofold from 50% to 95% after exposure to 5.92 mg L(-1)
      NH(3) , a level determined in the ammonia challenge bioassay as the 1-h LD50
      concentration for this species. Survival of TEX-OE(R)-pre-exposed fish was
      enhanced by 20% over non-exposed controls during lethal ammonia challenge (14.21 
      mg L(-1) NH(3) ). Increase in the levels of gill and muscle Hsp70 was evident in 
      TEX-OE(R)-pre-exposed fish but not in the unexposed controls, indicating that
      application of TEX-OE(R) accelerated carp endogenous Hsp70 synthesis during
      ammonia perturbation. Protection against ammonia was correlated with Hsp70
      accretion.

PG  - 165-74
LID - 10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.05.010 [doi]
AB  - Three glycosidic acids, turpethic acids A-C, and two intact resin glycosides,
      turpethosides A and B, all having a common pentasaccharide moiety and 12-hydroxy 
      fatty acid aglycones of different chain lengths, were obtained from the aerial
      parts of Operculina turpethum. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic 
      analyses and chemical correlations. The aglycones were characterized as
      12-hydroxypentadecanoic acid in two compounds, 12-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid in two
      other components, and 12-hydroxyheptadecanoic acid in the fifth compound, which
      were all confirmed by synthesis. The absolute configurations of these aglycones
      were all established as S by Mosher's method. These compounds represent the first

TI  - Time-dependent bioactivity of preparations from cactus pear (Opuntia ficus
      indica) and ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) on human skin fibroblasts
      and keratinocytes.
PG  - 438-44
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2012.05.014 [doi]
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditionally and nowadays preparations from two 
      xerophytic plants, the ice plant and cactus pear are used in dermatologic and
      cosmetic preparations. In spite of their daily use, little is known concerning
      the bioactivity of such extracts on skin cells. The purpose of this study was to 
      investigate the effect of pressed juices from ice plant (McP) and two cactus pear
      polysaccharides (cold water soluble, NwPS; non swelling pectin, NPec) on the cell
      physiology of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and HaCaT-keratinocytes due 
      to composition, concentration and incubation time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cactus 
      pear polysaccharides were analyzed by high performance anion exchange
      chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection after hydrolysis with
      trifluoroacetic acid. Ice plant pressed juices were filtrated through a 1.2 mum
      (McPI) and 0.2 mum filter (McPII). Cell proliferation was measured with BrdU
      incorporation assay. Reduction of tetrazolium salts was applied to determine the 
      metabolic activity (MTT) while necrotic effects were assessed by LDH-release
      measurements. RESULTS: Cactus pear polysaccharides differed predominantly in
      their glucose and uronic acid content. The filtration of pressed juices altered
      the amounts of high molecular weight compounds. The proliferation of NHDF and
      HaCaTs was significantly stimulated by cactus pear polysaccharides and ice plant 
      pressed juices not until 72 h of incubation. McPI significantly increased the
      proliferation of NHDF and HaCaTs while significant effect of McPII was only
      observed in case of HaCaT-keratinocytes. A dependence on concentration was not
      observed. Metabolic activity was neither influenced by McPI nor by McPII
      independent of incubation time. The HaCaT proliferation was not significantly
      influenced by low concentrations of cactus pear polysaccharides however it was
      inhibited by 100 mug/mL NPec. 100 mug/mL of NwPS and 1 mug/mL NPec stimulated the
      proliferation of fibroblasts. The metabolic activity of NHDF was not affected
      neither by NPec nor by NwPS. Independent of the used concentration NwPS
      significantly enhanced the metabolic activity of HaCaTs after 48 h of incubation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pressed juices of common ice plant and polysaccharides of cactus
      pear influenced the cell physiology of human keratinocytes and fibroblasts
      predominantly in a time-dependent manner. The effect was also be related to the
      concentration and composition as well as the investigated cell type.

TI  - Purification and characterization of an amylase from Opuntiaficus-indica seeds.
PG  - 61-6
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.5731 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Tunisia, prickly pear fruit grow spontaneously; it is consumed as 
      fresh fruit, juice or jam. When the fruit is used for juice production, the seeds
      are discarded and go to waste. Our study aimed to extract biomolecules from seeds
      by producing value-added products from the fruits. RESULTS: An amylase from
      Opuntia ficus-indica seeds was extracted and purified to homogeneity. An increase
      in specific activity of 113-fold was observed. The apparent molecular mass of the
      enzyme is 64 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature for enzyme activity were pH 5
      and 60 degrees C, respectively. Under these conditions, the specific activity is 
      245.5 U mg(-1) . The enzyme was activated by Co(2+) and Mg(2+) (relative activity
      117% and 113% respectively) at lower ion concentrations. It was strongly
      inhibited by Mn(2+) and Fe(2+) . Cu(2+) inhibited totally the activity of this
      enzyme, but Ca(2+) has an inhibitory effect which increases with ion
      concentration. CONCLUSION: The extracted enzyme belongs to the exo type of
      amylases and is classified as a beta-cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase since it
      generates mainly beta-cyclodextrin from starch. It exhibits high thermal
      stability and a broad range of pH stability, making it a promising prospect for
      industrial and food applications.

TI  - Ingestive behavior of pastured crossbred dairy cows offered different supplement 
      types.
PG  - 231-7
LID - 10.1007/s11250-012-0195-0 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of different supplements on the
      behavior variables of crossbred dairy cows that were in pasture that comprised
      two 4 x 4 Latin squares (four periods, four treatments, and four animals). Each
      experimental period lasted 15 days (10 days to adapt animals to treatments and 5 
      days for data collection). The animals were supplemented twice a day, with
      different forage (corn silage and cactus pear) and concentrate sources (soy mea +
      wheat meal + corn meal + cotton seed together and soy meal as a single
      constituent of the concentrate). A significant difference (p < 0.10) was observed
      for the percentage of time spent consuming the supplement and for idleness,
      rumination, and bite rate at the time of supplementation. The supplement intake
      period was greater for the cactus pear-based supplements due to the lower dry
      matter content. Those based on corn silage resulted in longer rumination periods 
      than those consisting of cactus pear; however, the opposite was observed for
      supplements based on the cactus, which showed higher percentages of time for
      idleness. The supplementation influenced the ingestive behavior of crossbred
      dairy cows.

TI  - Ephedra alte (joint pine): an invasive, problematic weedy species in forestry and
      fruit tree orchards in Jordan.
PG  - 971903
LID - 10.1100/2012/971903 [doi]
AB  - A field survey was carried out to record plant species climbed by Ephedra alte in
      certain parts of Jordan during 2008-2010. Forty species of shrubs, ornamental,
      fruit, and forest trees belonging to 24 plant families suffered from the climbing
      habit of E. alte. Growth of host plants was adversely affected by E. alte growth 
      that extended over their vegetation. In addition to its possible competition for 
      water and nutrients, the extensive growth it forms over host species prevents
      photosynthesis, smothers growth and makes plants die underneath the extensive
      cover. However, E. alte did not climb all plant species, indicating a host
      preference range. Damaged fruit trees included Amygdalus communis, Citrus
      aurantifolia, Ficus carica, Olea europaea, Opuntia ficus-indica, and Punica
      granatum. Forestry species that were adversely affected included Acacia
      cyanophylla, Ceratonia siliqua, Crataegus azarolus, Cupressus sempervirens, Pinus
      halepensis, Pistacia atlantica, Pistacia palaestina, Quercus coccifera, Quercus
      infectoria, Retama raetam, Rhamnus palaestina, Rhus tripartita, and Zizyphus
      spina-christi. Woody ornamentals attacked were Ailanthus altissima, Hedera helix,
      Jasminum fruticans, Jasminum grandiflorum, Nerium oleander, and Pyracantha
      coccinea. Results indicated that E. alte is a strong competitive for light and
      can completely smother plants supporting its growth. A. communis, F. carica, R.
      palaestina, and C. azarolus were most frequently attacked.

TI  - Monophyly, divergence times, and evolution of host plant use inferred from a
      revised phylogeny of the Drosophila repleta species group.
PG  - 533-44
LID - 10.1016/j.ympev.2012.05.012 [doi]
AB  - We present a revised molecular phylogeny of the Drosophila repleta group
      including 62 repleta group taxa and nine outgroup species based on four
      mitochondrial and six nuclear DNA sequence fragments. With ca. 100 species
      endemic to the New World, the repleta species group represents one of the major
      species radiations in the genus Drosophila. Most repleta group species are
      associated with cacti in arid or semiarid regions. Contrary to previous results, 
      maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies of the 10-gene dataset strongly
      support the monophyly of the repleta group. Several previously described
      subdivisions in the group were also recovered, despite poorly resolved
      relationships between these clades. Divergence time estimates suggested that the 
      repleta group split from its sister group about 21millionyears ago (Mya),
      although diversification of the crown group began ca. 16Mya. Character mapping of
      patterns of host plant use showed that flat leaf Opuntia use is common throughout
      the phylogeny and that shifts in host use from Opuntia to the more chemically
      complex columnar cacti occurred several times independently during the history of
      this group. Although some species retained the use of Opuntia after acquiring the
      use of columnar cacti, there were multiple, phylogenetically independent
      instances of columnar cactus specialization with loss of Opuntia as a host.
      Concordant with our proposed timing of host use shifts, these dates are
      consistent with the suggested times when the Opuntioideae originated in South
      America. We discuss the generally accepted South American origin of the repleta
      group.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of cryopreservation on sperm DNA fragmentation
      (SDF) in two cytometric sperm populations, PI(brighter) and PI(dimmer), and to
      test the effects of Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) extracts, which contain
      antioxidants and flavanoids, and of resveratrol on cryopreservation of human
      semen. DESIGN: In vitro prospective study. SETTING: Institutional study.
      PATIENT(S): Twenty-one normozoospermic men undergoing semen analysis for couple
      infertility. INTERVENTION(S): Cryopreservation using the routine method in the
      presence of OFI extracts or resveratrol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Measurement of 
      SDF by TUNEL/PI flow cytometric method to evaluate sperm motility (by automated
      motion analysis, CASA system) and viability (by eosin/nigrosin staining) in the
      two populations of sperm PI(br) and PI(dim). RESULT(S): Cryopreservation induced 
      an increase of SDF only in the PI(br) sperm population. The increase was
      negatively dependent on the basal values of SDF in the same population. Addition 
      of OFI extracts and resveratrol to the cryopreservation medium slightly but
      statistically significantly reduced SDF in the PI(br) population without
      affecting the deleterious effect of cryopreservation on sperm motion parameters
      or viability. CONCLUSION(S): The increase of SDF in the PI(br) population, which 
      is unrelated to semen quality, suggests that caution must be taken in using
      cryopreserved semen, as morphologically normal and motile sperm may be damaged.
      The addition of substances with multifunctional properties such as OFI extracts
      to cryopreservation medium is only slightly effective in preventing the dramatic 
      effects on SDF.

TI  - Native ecotypic variation and the role of host identity in the spread of an
      invasive herbivore, Cactoblastis cactorum.
PG  - 402-10
AB  - Environmental niche models (ENMs) have gained enormous popularity as tools to
      investigate potential changes in species distributions resulting from climate
      change and species introductions. Despite recognition that species interactions
      can influence the dynamics of invasion spread, most implementations of ENMs focus
      on abiotic factors as the sole predictors of potential range limits. Implicit in 
      this approach is the assumption that biotic interactions are relatively
      unimportant, either because of scaling issues, or because fundamental and
      realized niches are equivalent in a species' native range. When species are
      introduced into exotic landscapes, changes in biotic interactions relative to the
      native range can lead to occupation of different regions of niche space and
      apparent shifts in physiological tolerances. We use an escaped biological control
      organism, Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg.), to assess the role of the environmental 
      envelope as compared with patterns of host-herbivore associations based on
      collections made in the native range. Because all nonnative populations are
      derived from a single C. cactorum ecotype, we hypothesize that biotic
      interactions associated with this ecotype are driving the species' invasion
      dynamics. Environmental niche models constructed from known native populations
      perform poorly in predicting nonnative distributions of this species, except
      where there is an overlap in niche space. In contrast, genetic isolation in the
      native range is concordant with the observed pattern of host use, and strong host
      association has been noted in nonnative landscapes. Our results support the
      hypothesis that the apparent shift in niche space from the native to the exotic
      ranges results from a shift in biotic interactions, and demonstrate the
      importance of considering biotic interactions in assessing the risk of future
      spread for species whose native range is highly constrained by biotic
      interactions.

TI  - Opuntia in Mexico: identifying priority areas for conserving biodiversity in a
      multi-use landscape.
PG  - e36650
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0036650 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mexico is one of the world's centers of species diversity (richness) 
      for Opuntia cacti. Yet, in spite of their economic and ecological importance,
      Opuntia species remain poorly studied and protected in Mexico. Many of the
      species are sparsely but widely distributed across the landscape and are subject 
      to a variety of human uses, so devising implementable conservation plans for them
      presents formidable difficulties. Multi-criteria analysis can be used to design a
      spatially coherent conservation area network while permitting sustainable human
      usage. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Species distribution models were created for 60
      Opuntia species using MaxEnt. Targets of representation within conservation area 
      networks were assigned at 100% for the geographically rarest species and 10% for 
      the most common ones. Three different conservation plans were developed to
      represent the species within these networks using total area, shape, and
      connectivity as relevant criteria. Multi-criteria analysis and a metaheuristic
      adaptive tabu search algorithm were used to search for optimal solutions. The
      plans were built on the existing protected areas of Mexico and prioritized
      additional areas for management for the persistence of Opuntia species. All plans
      required around one-third of Mexico's total area to be prioritized for attention 
      for Opuntia conservation, underscoring the implausibility of Opuntia conservation
      through traditional land reservation. Tabu search turned out to be both
      computationally tractable and easily implementable for search problems of this
      kind. CONCLUSIONS: Opuntia conservation in Mexico require the management of large
      areas of land for multiple uses. The multi-criteria analyses identified priority 
      areas and organized them in large contiguous blocks that can be effectively
      managed. A high level of connectivity was established among the prioritized areas
      resulting in the enhancement of possible modes of plant dispersal as well as only
      a small number of blocks that would be recommended for conservation management.

AB  - Quercetin, rutin, naringin, hesperidin and chrysin were tested as substrates for 
      chloroperoxidase to produce reactive quinones to graft onto chitosan. Quercetin
      and rutin quinones were successfully chemically attached to low molecular weight 
      chitosan. The quercetin-modified chitosan showed an enhancement of plastic,
      antioxidant and antimicrobial properties as well as of thermal degradability.
      Finally, chitosan-quercetin films visibly decreased enzymatic oxidation when
      applied to Opuntia ficus indica cladodes.

      found stable in 4 M urea and exhibited inactivity of 50 % in 8 M urea
      concentration. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and cysteine-HCl were able to
      completely inhibit the enzyme activity at 1 mM and 100 muM, respectively.
      Preheated enzyme samples showed enhanced and stable catalytic activity in the
      presence of divalent cations over a period of 30 min compared with controls. In
      the presence of metal ions (1 mM Cu(2+) and 1 mM Mn(2+)), the preheated enzyme
      forms (60-90 degrees C) achieved 97 % of Malachite green and 98.75 % of Indigo
      blue (both at 2 %, w/v) dye decolorization in 12 h.

TI  - Development of cell lines from the cactophagous insect: Cactoblastis cactorum
      (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and their susceptibility to three baculoviruses.
PG  - 293-300
LID - 10.1007/s11626-012-9496-x [doi]
AB  - The unintentional introduction of the cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum, a
      successful biological control agent formerly employed in the control of invasive 
      prickly pear cactus species (Opuntia spp.) in Australia, Hawaii, South Africa,
      and various Caribbean islands, has posed great concern as to the possible threat 
      to native, endangered species of cactus in the southeastern USA as well as with
      the potential to cause a major infestation of commercial and agricultural cactus 
      crops in Mexico. A number of control measures have been investigated with varying
      degrees of success including, field exploration for cactus moth-specific
      parasitoids, insecticides, fungal, bacterial, and nematode agents. Current
      tactics used by the USA-Mexico binational program to eradicate cactus moth from
      Mexico and mitigate its westward movement in the USA include host plant removal, 
      the manual removal and destruction of egg sticks and infected cacti stems, and
      the Sterile Insect Technique. One other approach not taken until now is the
      development of a cactus moth cell line as a tool to facilitate the investigation 
      of baculoviruses as an alternative biocontrol method for the cactus moth.
      Consequently, we established C. cactorum cell lines derived from adult ovarian
      tissue designated as BCIRL-Cc-AM and BCIRL-Cc-JG. The mean cell population
      doubling time was 204.3 and 112 h for BCIRL-Cc-AM and BCIRL-Cc-JG, respectively, 
      with weekly medium change, while the doubling time was 176.6 and 192.6 h for
      BCIRL-Cc-AM and BCIRL-Cc-JG, respectively, with a daily change of medium. In
      addition, the daily versus weekly change in medium was reflected in the
      percentage viability with both cell lines showing higher levels with a daily
      medium change. Of the three baculoviruses tested, only the recombinant
      AcMNPV-hsp70Red and GmMNPV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0 were able 
      to demonstrate significant production of extracellular virus (ECV) in each of the
      cell lines, whereas both cell lines were refractive to an HzSNPV challenge at an 
      MOI of 10. In this study, we have demonstrated both the successful development of
      a C. cactorum cell line and its ability to support a complete baculovirus
      infection. The potential is also there to pursue further investigations to
      determine the susceptibility of the cactus moth cell line to other viruses.
      Additionally, the availability of a cactus moth cell line will facilitate the
      analysis of viruses prior to using the more expensive bioassay test. Finally, it 
      is hoped with the knowledge presented here that baculoviruses may also be
      considered as an alternative biocontrol method for the cactus moth.

      the group treated with free phenolic acid (FPA) fractions of H. opuntia,
      suggesting inducing effects on both enzymes. In addition, rats treated with FPA
      fractions displayed lower liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS)
      levels than those observed for rats in the CCl(4)-treated group. These data
      suggest that the phenolic fractions from H. opuntia may protect the liver against
      oxidative stress-inducing effects of chemicals by modulating its antioxidant
      enzymes and oxidative status.

TI  - Some analyses and recommendations on diet formulation for conservation breeding
      of the Galapagos rice rat of Isla Santiago, Nesoryzomys swarthi.
PG  - 498-505
LID - 10.1002/zoo.21006 [doi]
AB  - Nesoryzomys swarthi, the most endangered of the three surviving, endemic
      Galapagos "rice rats," was only discovered in the early 20th Century and was
      considered extinct until its rediscovery in 1997 at a north-central coastal
      location on Isla Santiago. Potential threats to the entire genus include invasive
      rodent species, feral cats, new diseases, and climate change. These threats have 
      been the basis for conservation breeding recommendations (as yet unmet) by
      several observers during the last several decades. This paper considers likely
      dietary requirements of N. swarthi in light of recent studies on the ecology of
      this species plus new data on the nutrient composition of Opuntia galapageia (a
      "resource refuge" for this species) and circulating vitamin values of animals
      sampled on Isla Santiago. It is concluded that, despite some unusually high
      mineral values for O. galapageia, a diet for N. swarthi under human care should
      be the same as it is for most other rodents, noting some caution in regard to
      possible needs for mineral and/or protein adjustment.

      reticulate evolution.
PG  - 847-64
LID - 10.3732/ajb.1100375 [doi]
AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The opuntias (nopales, prickly pears) are not only
      culturally, ecologically, economically, and medicinally important, but are
      renowned for their taxonomic difficulty due to interspecific hybridization,
      polyploidy, and morphological variability. Evolutionary relationships in these
      stem succulents have been insufficiently studied; thus, delimitation of Opuntia
      s.s. and major subclades, as well as the biogeographic history of this enigmatic 
      group, remain unresolved. METHODS: We sequenced the plastid intergenic spacers
      atpB-rbcL, ndhF-rpl32, psbJ-petA, and trnL-trnF, the plastid genes matK and ycf1,
      the nuclear gene ppc, and ITS to reconstruct the phylogeny of tribe Opuntieae,
      including Opuntia s.s. We used phylogenetic hypotheses to infer the biogeographic
      history, divergence times, and potential reticulate evolution of Opuntieae. KEY
      RESULTS: Within Opuntieae, a clade of Tacinga, Opuntia lilae, Brasiliopuntia, and
      O. schickendantzii is sister to a well-supported Opuntia s.s., which includes
      Nopalea. Opuntia s.s. originated in southwestern South America (SA) and then
      expanded to the Central Andean Valleys and the desert region of western North
      America (NA). Two major clades evolved in NA, which subsequently diversified into
      eight subclades. These expanded north to Canada and south to Central America and 
      the Caribbean, eventually returning back to SA primarily via allopolyploid taxa. 
      Dating approaches suggest that most of the major subclades in Opuntia s.s.
      originated during the Pliocene. CONCLUSIONS: Opuntia s.s. is a well-supported
      clade that includes Nopalea. The clade originated in southwestern SA, but the NA 
      radiation was the most extensive, resulting in broad morphological diversity and 
      frequent species formation through reticulate evolution and polyploidy.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effect of spineless cactus
      incorporation in food of dairy goats and growing kids on milk production and
      composition and on kid's growth and meat characteristics. Two experiments were
      conducted on Tunisian local goats. In the first, 30 females were divided into two
      groups; goats of Control group were reared on grazing pasture receiving indoor
      0.5 kg of hay and 0.4 kg of concentrate. Goats for the second group (Cac-FL) were
      kept in feedlot and fed cactus ad libitum more 0.5 kg of hay and 0.4 kg of
      concentrate. In the second experiment, 14 kids were divided into 2 groups
      receiving 600 g of hay. The Control group received ad libitum a concentrate
      containing 130 g crude protein (CP) per kg of dry matter. The second group
      received cactus ad-libitum plus the half concentrate quantity of control one with
      260 g CP/kg DM (Cactus). The daily milk production averaged 485 ml for Control
      group and 407 ml for Cac-FL one. The milk fat content was significantly higher
      for Control than Cac-FL group. In the second experiment, animals in Control and
      Cactus groups had similar growth rate. Carcass fat was significantly lower in
      Cactus than in the Control group. Cactus in the diet was associated with more
      C18:2 and conjugated linoleic acid as well as a higher proportion of PUFA than
      Control ones.

TI  - Host plant adaptation in Drosophila mettleri populations.
PG  - e34008
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0034008 [doi]
AB  - The process of local adaptation creates diversity among allopatric populations,
      and may eventually lead to speciation. Plant-feeding insect populations that
      specialize on different host species provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate
      the causes of ecological specialization and the subsequent consequences for
      diversity. In this study, we used geographically separated Drosophila mettleri
      populations that specialize on different host cacti to examine oviposition
      preference for and larval performance on an array of natural and non-natural
      hosts (eight total). We found evidence of local adaptation in performance on
      saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) for populations that are typically associated
      with this host, and to chemically divergent prickly pear species (Opuntia spp.)
      in a genetically isolated population on Santa Catalina Island. Moreover, each
      population exhibited reduced performance on the alternative host. This finding is
      consistent with trade-offs associated with adaptation to these chemically
      divergent hosts, although we also discuss alternative explanations for this
      pattern. For oviposition preference, Santa Catalina Island flies were more likely
      to oviposit on some prickly pear species, but all populations readily laid eggs
      on saguaro. Experiments with non-natural hosts suggest that factors such as
      ecological opportunity may play a more important role than host plant chemistry
      in explaining the lack of natural associations with some hosts.

PG  - 273-80
AB  - Alcoholism is a medical, social, and economic problem where treatment methods
      mostly include difficult and long-lasting psychotherapy and, in some cases, quite
      controversial pharmacological approaches. A number of medicinal plants and pure
      natural compounds are reported to have preventive and therapeutic effects on
      alcoholism and alcohol dependency, but their constituents, efficacy and mechanism
      of action are mostly unknown so far. Recently, kudzu [Pueraria lobata (Willd.)
      Ohwi], St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza
      Bge.), ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Mey.), Japanese raisin tree (Hovenia dulcis
      Thunb.), ibogaine (Tabernanthe iboga H. Bn.), evening primrose (Oenothera biennis
      L.), prickly pear fruit (Opuntia ficus indica (L.) Mill.), purple passionflower
      (Passiflora incarnata L.), thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), fenugreek seed (Trigonella
      foenum-graecum L.), ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) and many others drew the 
      attention of researchers. Can, therefore, drugs of natural origin be helpful in
      the treatment of alcoholism or in decreasing alcohol consumption?

PG  - 235-43
LID - 10.1016/j.alcohol.2011.09.024 [doi]
AB  - Juice from the fruit of the cactus Opuntia ficus indica is claimed to possess
      several health-beneficial properties. The present study was carried out to
      determine whether O. ficus indica f. inermis fruit extract might have a
      protective effect upon physiological and morphological damages inflicted to
      erythrocytes membrane by chronic ethanol poisoning, per os, in rat. Chemical
      analysis of the extract revealed the presence of polyphenols, flavonoids,
      ascorbic acid, carotenoids, and betalains. Ethanol administration (3 g/kg b.w,
      per day for 90 days) induced an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) and
      carbonylated proteins levels and a decrease of glutathione (GSH) level in
      erythrocyte. Ethanol administration also reduced the scavenging activity in
      plasma and enhanced erythrocytes hemolysis, as compared to control rats. In
      addition, ethanol intake increased the erythrocyte shape index by +895.5% and
      decreased the erythrocyte diameter by -61.53% as compared to controls. In animals
      also given prickly pear juice during the same experimental period, the studied
      parameters were much less shifted. This protective effect was found to be
      dose-dependent. It is likely that the beneficial effect of the extract is due to 
      the high content of antioxidant compounds.

      studies have revealed that consumption of poultry products is an important risk
      factor of this disease. Adherence and cytotoxic activity of the bacteria to host 
      mucosal surfaces have been proposed to be critical steps in pathogenesis.
      Innovative tools for controlling Campylobacter, such as natural products from
      plants, represent good alternatives for use in foods or as therapeutic agents. In
      this study, 28 edible or medicinal plants species were analyzed for their
      bactericidal effects on the growth of Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli. The
      extracts of Acacia farnesiana, Artemisia ludoviciana, Opuntia ficus-indica, and
      Cynara scolymus were the most effective against these microorganisms at minimal
      bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of 0.3, 0.5, 0.4, and 2.0 mg/mL, respectively.
      No effect on growth was detected with lower concentrations of extract (25%, 50%, 
      or 75% of the MBC) added to the media. The effect of each extract (75% of the
      MBC) on adherence and cytotoxicity of C. jejuni and C. coli was evaluated in Vero
      cells. Adherence of Campylobacter to Vero cells was significantly affected by all
      the extracts. Cytotoxic activity of bacterial cultures was inhibited by A.
      farnesiana and A. ludoviciana. These plant extracts are potential candidates to
      be studied for controlling Campylobacter contamination in foods and the diseases 
      associated with this microorganism. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Innovative tools for
      controlling Campylobacter, such as natural products from plants, represent good
      alternatives for use in foods or as therapeutic agents. The extracts of Acacia
      farnesiana, Artemisia ludoviciana, Opuntia ficus-indica, and Cynara scolymus were
      the most effective against these microorganisms. Adherence and cytotoxic activity
      of the bacteria to host mucosal surfaces which are critical steps in pathogenesis
      were decreased by these extracts. Our results point to these plants as potential 
      candidates for the control of Campylobacter contamination in foods, the treatment
      of the diseases associated with this microorganism, and as feed supplements to
      reduce on-farm prevalence of Campylobacter.

AB  - A procedure for designing starter cultures for fermentation is illustrated for
      prickly pear wine production. The illustration includes kinetic studies on
      inoculated and spontaneous fermentation, microorganism identification studies
      based on molecular biology tools, and microbial ecology studies, which led to the
      selection of strains that are capable of synthesizing alcohol and desirable
      volatile compounds. Results show that a mixed starter inoculum containing Pichia 
      fermentans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to a fermented product that
      contains 8.37% alcohol (v/v). The gas chromatography and mass spectrometry
      (GC-MS) analysis shows the presence of 9 major volatile compounds (Isobutanol,
      Isopentanol, Ethyl acetate, Isoamyl acetate, Ethyl octanoate, Ethyl decanoate,
      Ethyl 9-decanoate, beta-Phenylethyl acetate, and Phenylethyl alcohol) that have
      ethereal, fruity, aromatic notes that are considered to be essential for a fine
      wine flavor. These compounds harmonically synergize with the alcohol to produce a
      fermented product with a unique flavor and taste. Several assays using the mixed 
      culture show that the process is stable, predictable, controllable, and
      reproducible. Moreover, the results show that a mixed culture leads to a broader 
      range of aromatic products than that produced by a single, pure culture.
      Therefore, we conclude that combinations of Saccharomyces strains and
      non-Saccharomyces strains can be used to obtain high-quality fermented beverages 
      from prickly pear juice.

PG  - 4553-9
LID - 10.1021/es2021999 [doi]
AB  - High concentrations of arsenic in groundwater continue to present health threats 
      to millions of consumers worldwide. Particularly, affected communities in the
      developing world need accessible technologies for arsenic removal from drinking
      water. We explore the application of cactus mucilage, pectic polysaccharide
      extracts from Opuntia ficus-indica for arsenic removal. Synthetic arsenate (As
      (V)) solutions were treated with two extracts, a gelling extract (GE) and a
      nongelling extract (NE) in batch trials. The arsenic concentration at the
      air-water interface was measured after equilibration. The GE and NE treated
      solutions showed on average 14% and 9% increases in arsenic concentration at the 
      air-water interface respectively indicating that the mucilage bonded and
      transported the arsenic to the air-water interface. FTIR studies showed that the 
      -CO groups (carboxyl and carbonyl groups) and -OH (hydroxyl) functional groups of
      the mucilage were involved in the interaction with the arsenate. Mucilage
      activity was greater in weakly basic (pH 9) and weakly acidic (pH 5.5) pH. This
      interaction can be optimized and harnessed for the removal of arsenic from
      drinking water. This work breaks the ground for the application of natural pectic
      materials to the removal of anionic metallic species from water.

      relationships of P opuntiae with P djamor, P. agaves, P. levis, and P. yuccae are
      presented, of which P. agaves is a synonym of P. opuntiae, and P. yuccae is a
      synonym of P. djamor. This latter and P levis are close species of P. opuntiae.
      The traditional uses of P opuntiae and P. djamor as food and remedy for several
      health problems, and also to get a traditional alcoholic drink from the Agave,
      are also considered.

TI  - Inception of maleness: auxin contribution to flower masculinization in the
      dioecious cactus Opuntia stenopetala.
PG  - 225-38
LID - 10.1007/s00425-012-1602-5 [doi]
AB  - In Opuntia stenopetala, flowers initiate as hermaphrodite; however, at maturity, 
      only the stamens in male flowers and the gynoecium in female flowers become
      functional. At early developmental stages, growth and morphogenesis of the
      gynoecium in male flowers cease, forming a short style lacking stigmatic tissue
      at maturity. Here, an analysis of the masculinization process of this species and
      its relationship with auxin metabolism during gynoecium morphogenesis is
      presented. Histological analysis and scanning electron microscopy were performed;
      auxin levels were immunoanalyzed and exogenous auxin was applied to developing
      gynoecia. Male flower style-tissue patterning revealed morphological defects in
      the vascular bundles, stylar canal, and transmitting tissue. These features are
      similar to those observed in Arabidopsis thaliana mutant plants affected in auxin
      transport, metabolism, or signaling. Notably, when comparing auxin levels between
      male and female gynoecia from O. stenopetala at an early developmental stage, we 
      found that they were particularly low in the male gynoecium. Consequently,
      exogenous auxin application on male gynoecia partially restored the defects of
      gynoecium development. We therefore hypothesize that, the arrest in male flower
      gynoecia patterning could be related to altered auxin homeostasis; alternatively,
      the addition of auxin could compensate for the lack of another unknown factor
      affecting male flower gynoecium development.

AB  - The antimicrobial effects of the Mexican medicinal plants Guazuma ulmifolia,
      Justicia spicigera, Opuntia joconostle, O. leucotricha, Parkinsonia aculeata,
      Phoradendron longifolium, P. serotinum, Psittacanthus calyculatus, Tecoma stans
      and Teucrium cubense were tested against several human multi-drug resistant
      pathogens, including three Gram (+) and five Gram (-) bacterial species and three
      fungal species using the disk-diffusion assay. The cytotoxicity of plant extracts
      on human cancer cell lines and human normal non-cancerous cells was also
      evaluated using the MTT assay. Phoradendron longifolium, Teucrium cubense,
      Opuntia joconostle, Tecoma stans and Guazuma ulmifolia showed potent
      antimicrobial effects against at least one multidrug-resistant microorganism
      (inhibition zone > 15 mm). Only Justicia spicigera and Phoradendron serotinum
      extracts exerted active cytotoxic effects on human breast cancer cells (IC50 < or
      = 30 microg/mL). The results showed that Guazuma ulmifolia produced potent
      antimicrobial effects against Candida albicans and Acinetobacter lwoffii, whereas
      Justicia spicigera and Phoradendron serotinum exerted the highest toxic effects
      on MCF-7 and HeLa, respectively, which are human cancer cell lines. These three
      plant species may be important sources of antimicrobial and cytotoxic agents.

AB  - The nature reserve of Tehuacan-Cuicatlan in central Mexico is known for its
      diversity and endemism mainly in cactus plants. Although the xerophytic flora is 
      reasonably documented, the bacterial communities associated with these species
      have been largely neglected. We assessed the diversity and composition of
      bacterial communities in bulk (non-rhizospheric) soil and the rhizosphere of
      three cactus plant species: Mammillaria carnea, Opuntia pilifera and Stenocereus 
      stellatus, approached using cultivation and molecular techniques, considering the
      possible effect of dry and rainy seasons. Cultivation-dependent methods were
      focused on putative N(2)-fixers and heterotrophic aerobic bacteria, in the two
      media tested the values obtained for dry season samples grouped together
      regardless of the sample type (rhizospheric or non-rhizospheric), these groups
      also included the non-rhizospheric sample for rainy season, on each medium. These
      CFU values were smaller and significantly different from those obtained on
      rhizospheric samples from rainy season. Genera composition among isolates of the 
      rhizospheric samples was very similar for each season, the most abundant taxa
      being alpha-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Interestingly, the
      genus Ochrobactrum was highly represented among rhizospheric samples, when
      cultured in N-free medium. The structure of the bacterial communities was
      approached with molecular techniques targeting partial 16S rRNA sequences such as
      denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and serial analysis of ribosomal sequence
      tags. Under these approaches, the most represented bacterial phyla were
      Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. The first two were also highly 
      represented when using isolation techniques.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of Opuntia ficus
      indica f. inermis fruit juice (OFIj) on reversing oxidative damages induced by
      chronic ethanol intake in rat erythrocytes. OFIj was firstly analyzed with HPLC
      for phenolic and flavonoids content. Secondly, 40 adult male Wistar rats were
      equally divided into five groups and treated for 90 days as follows: control (C),
      ethanol-only 3 g/kg body weight (b.w) (E), low dose of OFIj 2 ml/100 g
      b.w+ethanol (Ldj+E), high dose of OFIj 4 ml/100 g b.w+ethanol (Hdj+E), and only a
      high dose of OFIj 4 ml/100g b.w (Hdj). HPLC analysis indicated high
      concentrations of phenolic acids and flavonoids in OFIj. Ethanol treatment
      markedly decreased the activities of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD),
      catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and the level of reduced
      glutathione (GSH). Changes in the erythrocyte's antioxidant ability were
      accompanied by enhanced oxidative modification of lipids (increase of
      malondialdeyde level) and proteins (increase in carbonyl groups). Interestingly, 
      pre-administration of either 2 ml/100 g b.w or 4 ml/100 g b.w of OFIj to
      ethanol-intoxicated rats significantly reversed decreases in enzymatic as well as
      non enzymatic antioxidants parameters in erythrocytes. Also, the administration
      of OFIj significantly protected lipids and proteins against ethanol-induced
      oxidative modifications in rat erythrocytes. The beneficial effect of OFIj can
      result from the inhibition of ethanol-induced free radicals chain reactions in
      rat erythrocytes or from the enhancement of the endogenous antioxidants
      activities.

TI  - Cytogeography of the Humifusa clade of Opuntia s.s. Mill. 1754 (Cactaceae,
      Opuntioideae, Opuntieae): correlations with pleistocene refugia and morphological
      traits in a polyploid complex.
PG  - 53-77
LID - 10.3897/CompCytogen.v6i1.2523 [doi]
AB  - Ploidy has been well studied and used extensively in the genus Opuntia to
      determine species boundaries, detect evidence of hybridization, and infer
      evolutionary patterns. We carried out chromosome counts for all members of the
      Humifusa clade to ascertain whether geographic patterns are associated with
      differences in ploidy. We then related chromosomal data to observed morphological
      variability, polyploid formation, and consequently the evolutionary history of
      the clade. We counted chromosomes of 277 individuals from throughout the ranges
      of taxa included within the Humifusa clade, with emphasis placed on the widely
      distributed species, Opuntia humifusa (Raf.) Raf., 1820 s.l. and Opuntia
      macrorhiza Engelm., 1850 s.l. We also compiled previous counts made for species
      in the clade along with our new counts to plot geographic distributions of the
      polyploid and diploid taxa. A phylogeny using nuclear ribosomal ITS sequence data
      was reconstructed to determine whether ploidal variation is consistent with
      cladogenesis. We discovered that diploids of the Humifusa clade are restricted to
      the southeastern United States (U.S.), eastern Texas, and southeastern New
      Mexico. Polyploid members of the clade, however, are much more widely
      distributed, occurring as far north as the upper midwestern U.S. (e.g., Michigan,
      Minnesota, Wisconsin). Morphological differentiation, although sometimes cryptic,
      is commonly observed among diploid and polyploid cytotypes, and such
      morphological distinctions may be useful in diagnosing possible cryptic species. 
      Certain polyploid populations of Opuntia humifusa s.l. and Opuntia macrorhiza
      s.l., however, exhibit introgressive morphological characters, complicating
      species delineations. Phylogenetically, the Humifusa clade forms two subclades
      that are distributed, respectively, in the southeastern U.S. (including all
      southeastern U.S. diploids, polyploid Opuntia abjecta Small, 1923, and polyploid 
      Opuntia pusilla (Haw.) Haw., 1812) and the southwestern U.S. (including all
      southwestern U.S. diploids and polyploids). In addition, tetraploid Opuntia
      humifusa s.l., which occurs primarily in the eastern U.S., is resolved in the
      southwestern diploid clade instead of with the southeastern diploid clade that
      includes diploid Opuntia humifusa s.l. Our results not only provide evidence for 
      the polyphyletic nature of Opuntia humifusa and Opuntia macrorhiza, suggesting
      that each of these represents more than one species, but also demonstrate the
      high frequency of polyploidy in the Humifusa clade and the major role that genome
      duplication has played in the diversification of this lineage of Opuntia s.s. Our
      data also suggest that the southeastern and southwestern U.S. may represent
      glacial refugia for diploid members of this clade and that the clade as a whole
      should be considered a mature polyploid species complex. Widespread polyploids
      are likely derivatives of secondary contact among southeastern and southwestern
      diploid taxa as a result of the expansion and contraction of suitable habitat
      during the Pleistocene following glacial and interglacial events.

PG  - 607-11
AB  - Opuntia ficus indica and Pistacia lentiscus L. seeds are used in traditional
      medicine. The objective of this study was to investigate the toxicity of the
      fixed oil of Opuntia ficus indica and Pistacia lentiscus L. seeds in mice through
      determination of LD(5)(0) values, and also the physicochemical characteristics of
      the fixed oil of these oils. The acute toxicity of their fixed oil were also
      investigated in mice using the method of Kabba and Berhens. The fixed oil of
      Pistacia lentiscus and Opuntia ficus indica seeds were extracted and analyzed for
      its chemical and physical properties such as acid value, free fatty acid
      percentage (% FFA), iodine index, and saponification value as well as refractive 
      index and density. LD(5)(0) values obtained by single doses, orally and
      intraperitoneally administered in mice, were respectively 43 +/- 0,8 ;[40.7- 45.4
      ] ml/kg body wt. p.o. and 2.72 +/- 0,1 ;[2.52-2.92] ml/kg body wt. i.p. for
      Opuntia ficus indica ; and 37 +/- 1 ;[34.4 - 39.8 ] ml/kg body wt. p.o. and 2.52 
      +/- 0,2 ;[2.22 - 2.81 ] ml/kg body wt. i.p. for Pistacia lentiscus respectively. 
      The yields of seed oil were respectively calculated as 20.25% and 10.41%. The
      acid and free fatty acid values indicated that the oil has a low acidity.

TI  - Individual and combined effects of postharvest dip treatments with water at 50
      degrees C, soy lecithin and sodium carbonate on cold stored cactus pear fruits.
PG  - 207-17
AB  - Objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of prestorage dip treatments
      at 20 degrees C or 50 degrees C alone or with sodium carbonate (SC) and soy
      lecithin (LEC), either individually or in combination, on weight losses, peel
      disorders, overall appearance and decay of cactus pears. Fruits were subjected to
      a simulated Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) disinfestation by cold quarantine at
      2 degrees C for 21 days followed by one week of shelf-life at 20 degrees C. Hot
      water alone was very effective in reducing peel disorders and decay both during
      cold storage and shelf-life. SC applied at 20 degrees C showed a weak control of 
      decay and chilling injury, while its effectiveness significantly increased when
      the solution temperature was set to 50 degrees C. LEC was more effective in
      preserving freshness during cold storage, but after shelf-life decay incidence in
      fruit dipped in LEC at 20 degrees C or 50 degrees C was higher than in those
      dipped in water at 20 degrees C or 50 degrees C, respectively. Significant but
      moderate differences were detected among treatments in weight loss. After
      shelf-life, fruit dipped in the heated mixture of SC and LEC showed the lowest
      incidence of peel disorders and the highest percentage of marketable fruit,
      although decay incidence was slightly higher than in fruit treated with SC at 50 
      degrees C. SC and LEC used in combination at 50 degrees C improved fruit
      tolerance to chilling injury and reduced decay.

TI  - Predicting incursion of plant invaders into Kruger National Park, South Africa:
      the interplay of general drivers and species-specific factors.
PG  - e28711
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0028711 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overcoming boundaries is crucial for incursion of alien plant species
      and their successful naturalization and invasion within protected areas. Previous
      work showed that in Kruger National Park, South Africa, this process can be
      quantified and that factors determining the incursion of invasive species can be 
      identified and predicted confidently. Here we explore the similarity between
      determinants of incursions identified by the general model based on a
      multispecies assemblage, and those identified by species-specific models. We
      analyzed the presence and absence of six invasive plant species in 1.0x1.5 km
      segments along the border of the park as a function of environmental
      characteristics from outside and inside the KNP boundary, using two data-mining
      techniques: classification trees and random forests. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The
      occurrence of Ageratum houstonianum, Chromolaena odorata, Xanthium strumarium,
      Argemone ochroleuca, Opuntia stricta and Lantana camara can be reliably predicted
      based on landscape characteristics identified by the general multispecies model, 
      namely water runoff from surrounding watersheds and road density in a 10 km
      radius. The presence of main rivers and species-specific combinations of
      vegetation types are reliable predictors from inside the park. CONCLUSIONS: The
      predictors from the outside and inside of the park are complementary, and are
      approximately equally reliable for explaining the presence/absence of current
      invaders; those from the inside are, however, more reliable for predicting future
      invasions. Landscape characteristics determined as crucial predictors from
      outside the KNP serve as guidelines for management to enact proactive
      interventions to manipulate landscape features near the KNP to prevent further
      incursions. Predictors from the inside the KNP can be used reliably to identify
      high-risk areas to improve the cost-effectiveness of management, to locate
      invasive plants and target them for eradication.

TI  - Effects of drying process on the physicochemical properties of nopal cladodes at 
      different maturity stages.
PG  - 44-9
LID - 10.1007/s11130-011-0265-x [doi]
AB  - Chemical proximate analysis was done in order to determine the changes of
      nutritional characteristics of nopal powders from three different maturity stages
      50, 100, and 150 days and obtained by three different drying processes: freeze
      dried, forced air oven, and tunnel. Results indicate that nopal powder obtained
      by the process of freeze dried retains higher contents of protein, soluble fiber,
      and fat than the other two processes. Also, freeze dried process had less effect 
      on color hue variable. No changes were observed in insoluble fiber content,
      chroma and lightness with the three different drying processes. Furthermore, the 
      soluble fibers decreased with the age of nopal while insoluble fibers and ash
      content shows an opposite trend. In addition, the luminosity and hue values did
      not show differences among the maturity stages studied. The high content of
      dietary fibers of nopal pad powder could to be an interesting source of these
      important components for human diets and also could be used in food, cosmetics
      and pharmaceutical industry.

TI  - Targets of an invasive species: oviposition preference and larval performance of 
      Cactoblastis cactorum (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) on 14 North American opuntioid
      cacti.
PG  - 1884-92
LID - 10.1603/EN10022 [doi]
AB  - Cactoblastis cactorum Berg (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), the cactus moth, is a
      well-known biological control agent of prickly pear cactus (Cactaceae: Opuntia
      Miller). The arrival of the moth in Florida and its subsequent spread through the
      southeastern United States poses a threat to opuntioid diversity in North
      America. Of particular concern are the ecological and economic impacts the moth
      could have in the southwestern United States and Mexico, where both native and
      cultivated Opuntia species are important resources. It is unknown which species
      would best support larval development if the moth were to spread further westward
      in North America. This study aimed to determine if ovipositing females
      demonstrate preferences for any of 14 common opuntioids native to or naturalized 
      in Mexico and the southwestern United States; which of these opuntioids best
      support larval development; and if oviposition preference correlates with larval 
      performance, as predicted by simple adaptive models. Results from a field
      experiment showed that female moths preferred O. engelmannii Salm-Dyck ex
      Engelmann variety linguiformis (Griffiths) Parfitt and Pinkava and O. engelmannii
      variety engelmannii for oviposition. A generalized linear model showed number of 
      cladodes and degree of spininess to be significant predictors of oviposition
      activity. Results from a no-choice larval survival experiment showed Consolea
      rubescens (Salm-Dyck ex de Candolle.) Lemaire and O. streptacantha Lemaire to be 
      the best hosts. Epidermal toughness was a significant predictor of most larval
      fitness parameters. In general, oviposition preference was not correlated with
      larval performance. A lack of co-evolutionary history between C. cactorum and
      North American opuntioid species may help explain this disconnect.

TI  - Quantitative determination of pregnanes from aerial parts of Caralluma species
      using HPLC-UV and identification by LC-ESI-TOF.
PG  - 1383-90
AB  - An HPLC method was developed for the quantitative determination of five pregnane 
      derivatives from aerial parts of Caralluma species and dietary supplements. The
      method was validated for linearity, repeatability, LOD, and LOQ. The LOD and LOQ 
      of five pregnane compounds were found to be in the range of 1-5 and 3-15
      microg/mL, respectively, by HPLC using photodiode array detection. This method
      was applied to the identification of three plant materials of Caralluma species
      (C. fimbriata, C. umbellate, and C. attentuata) and seven dietary supplements
      claiming to contain C. fimbriata. An LCIMS coupled with electrospray ionization
      interface method was used for the identification of compounds and involved the
      use of [M+Na]+ ions in the positive ion mode with extracted ion chromatogram.

TI  - Betalain: a particular class of antioxidant pigment.
PG  - 1425-31
AB  - We have analyzed the stability of betalains in juices prepared from Moroccan
      yellow cactus pears (Opuntia ficus indica (L.) Mill.) as a function of
      temperature and pH. The experiments were carried out at temperatures ranging from
      80 to 100 degrees C with juices at pH 3.5, 5 and 6.5. The degree of pigment
      retention decreased when the temperature increased. The degradation constant
      rates were determined for thermal degradation rates of pseudo-first order. The
      Arrhenius plot obtained for the degradation of betaxanthin from the yellow fruits
      was not linear. Regardless of the temperature of treatment, the lowest
      degradation was obtained for pH 5. When some stabilizers were tested for the
      protection of pigments, the results showed that ascorbic acid was a better
      protective agent at pH 3.5, increasing the protection by 40%. The inhibitive
      action of betalain pigments extracted from cactus pears towards corrosion of
      stainless steel in phosphoric acid was investigated using electrochemical
      polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. It was
      found that the presence of natural pigments reduces the corrosion rate of the
      tested metal, especially on addition of the red pigments (97%). The inhibition
      efficiency increases as the pigment concentration of extracts increases. It was
      also found that the pigments tested act as mixed inhibitors. The inhibitive
      action of the extracts is discussed in term of adsorption and that such
      adsorption follows a Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The calculated values of the
      free energy of adsorption indicated that the adsorption process is spontaneous.

TI  - Effect of Opuntia streptacantha Lem. on alpha-glucosidase activity.
PG  - 493-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2011.11.039 [doi]
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In Mexico, Opuntia streptacantha is used as part 
      of a traditional medicine in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Several studies 
      have reported an anti-hyperglycemic effect from the plant, but none have focused 
      on finding a mechanism of action to explain these results. This paper focuses on 
      one of the most recurrent hypotheses for the effect of O. streptacantha: the
      mechanism of action is the hydrolysis of disaccharides, either by enzymatically
      inhibiting the alpha glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) or mechanically acting as a
      barrier. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To test our hypothesis, three different
      experiments were performed. A maltose tolerance test was carried out using the
      total extract (TE) and the juice of the plant. Six different extracts were tested
      in a free-enzyme assay, four of which were aqueous extracts varying according to 
      the procedure of removing the insoluble particles in an attempt to reduce the
      loss of the water-soluble compounds. The main component of the total extract, a
      derivative of (4-hydroxy)-phenyl acetic acid, was also tested. For both the
      maltose tolerance test and the free-enzyme assay, acarbose was used as a control 
      drug. Finally, an everted small intestine assay was also performed. RESULTS AND
      CONCLUSIONS: The maltose tolerance test confirmed that an anti-hyperglycemic
      effect occurs at doses of 100 mg/kg TE and 4 mL/kg juice. No inhibition on AGIs
      was observed in the free-enzyme assay, and neither a mechanic nor enzymatic
      effect on disaccharide hydrolysis was observed in the everted intestine assay.
      CONCLUSIONS: The anti-hyperglycemic effect of O. streptacantha was confirmed, and
      the results presented here contribute to the understanding that this effect is
      not due to the action on alpha-glucosidases or related to the intestinal
      hydrolysis of disaccharides.

AB  - Facial packs or masks are popular beauty treatments that are thought to improve
      skin quality. We formulated a yoghurt pack using natural ingredients (F-YOP),
      with consideration of skin affinity, safety, health, and beauty. Then, we
      performed an in vitro assessment of biological activity and in vivo assessments
      of moisture, TEWL, melanin content, and elasticity. Facial areas treated with
      F-YOP showed increased moisture compared to control regions: 89+/-6.26%
      (forehead), 140.72+/-10.19% (cheek), and 123.29+/-6.67% (chin). Transepidermal
      water loss (TEWL) values were decreased in the treated areas compared to control:
      101.38+/-6.95% (forehead), 50.37+/-5.93% (cheek), and l57.81+/-10.88% (chin).
      Elasticity was decreased in the control region, whereas the treatment region did 
      not change. The initial elasticity was maintained in the cheek. F-YOP exhibited
      activity on DPPH radical scavenging, SOD-like activity, and lipoxygenase
      activity. F-YOP treatment successfully improved the moisture, brightness, and
      elasticity of treated skin.

TI  - Effects of coral reef benthic primary producers on dissolved organic carbon and
      microbial activity.
PG  - e27973
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0027973 [doi]
AB  - Benthic primary producers in marine ecosystems may significantly alter
      biogeochemical cycling and microbial processes in their surrounding environment. 
      To examine these interactions, we studied dissolved organic matter release by
      dominant benthic taxa and subsequent microbial remineralization in the lagoonal
      reefs of Moorea, French Polynesia. Rates of photosynthesis, respiration, and
      dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release were assessed for several common benthic
      reef organisms from the backreef habitat. We assessed microbial community
      response to dissolved exudates of each benthic producer by measuring
      bacterioplankton growth, respiration, and DOC drawdown in two-day dark dilution
      culture incubations. Experiments were conducted for six benthic producers: three 
      species of macroalgae (each representing a different algal phylum: Turbinaria
      ornata--Ochrophyta; Amansia rhodantha--Rhodophyta; Halimeda
      opuntia--Chlorophyta), a mixed assemblage of turf algae, a species of crustose
      coralline algae (Hydrolithon reinboldii) and a dominant hermatypic coral (Porites
      lobata). Our results show that all five types of algae, but not the coral, exuded
      significant amounts of labile DOC into their surrounding environment. In general,
      primary producers with the highest rates of photosynthesis released the most DOC 
      and yielded the greatest bacterioplankton growth; turf algae produced nearly
      twice as much DOC per unit surface area than the other benthic producers
      (14.0+/-2.8 micromol h(-)(1) dm(-)(2)), stimulating rapid bacterioplankton growth
      (0.044+/-0.002 log10 cells h(-)(1)) and concomitant oxygen drawdown (0.16+/-0.05 
      micromol L(-)(1) h(-)(1) dm(-)(2)). Our results demonstrate that benthic reef
      algae can release a significant fraction of their photosynthetically-fixed carbon
      as DOC, these release rates vary by species, and this DOC is available to and
      consumed by reef associated microbes. These data provide compelling evidence that

TI  - Microbial to reef scale interactions between the reef-building coral Montastraea 
      annularis and benthic algae.

AB  - Competition between reef-building corals and benthic algae is of key importance
      for reef dynamics. These interactions occur on many spatial scales, ranging from 
      chemical to regional. Using microprobes, 16S rDNA pyrosequencing and underwater
      surveys, we examined the interactions between the reef-building coral Montastraea
      annularis and four types of benthic algae. The macroalgae Dictyota bartayresiana 
      and Halimeda opuntia, as well as a mixed consortium of turf algae, caused hypoxia
      on the adjacent coral tissue. Turf algae were also associated with major shifts
      in the bacterial communities at the interaction zones, including more pathogens
      and virulence genes. In contrast to turf algae, interactions with crustose
      coralline algae (CCA) and M. annularis did not appear to be antagonistic at any
      scale. These zones were not hypoxic, the microbes were not pathogen-like and the 
      abundance of coral-CCA interactions was positively correlated with per cent coral
      cover. We propose a model in which fleshy algae (i.e. some species of turf and
      fleshy macroalgae) alter benthic competition dynamics by stimulating bacterial
      respiration and promoting invasion of virulent bacteria on corals. This gives
      fleshy algae a competitive advantage over corals when human activities, such as
      overfishing and eutrophication, remove controls on algal abundance. Together,
      these results demonstrate the intricate connections and mechanisms that structure
      coral reefs.

TI  - Social network models predict movement and connectivity in ecological landscapes.
PG  - 19282-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1107549108 [doi]
AB  - Network analysis is on the rise across scientific disciplines because of its
      ability to reveal complex, and often emergent, patterns and dynamics.
      Nonetheless, a growing concern in network analysis is the use of limited data for
      constructing networks. This concern is strikingly relevant to ecology and
      conservation biology, where network analysis is used to infer connectivity across
      landscapes. In this context, movement among patches is the crucial parameter for 
      interpreting connectivity but because of the difficulty of collecting reliable
      movement data, most network analysis proceeds with only indirect information on
      movement across landscapes rather than using observed movement to construct
      networks. Statistical models developed for social networks provide promising
      alternatives for landscape network construction because they can leverage limited
      movement information to predict linkages. Using two mark-recapture datasets on
      individual movement and connectivity across landscapes, we test whether commonly 
      used network constructions for interpreting connectivity can predict actual
      linkages and network structure, and we contrast these approaches to social
      network models. We find that currently applied network constructions for
      assessing connectivity consistently, and substantially, overpredict actual
      connectivity, resulting in considerable overestimation of metapopulation
      lifetime. Furthermore, social network models provide accurate predictions of
      network structure, and can do so with remarkably limited data on movement. Social
      network models offer a flexible and powerful way for not only understanding the
      factors influencing connectivity but also for providing more reliable estimates
      of connectivity and metapopulation persistence in the face of limited data.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) acetate, propionate and butyrate are
      the major anions produced by the bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber (DF) in 
      colon. Recently, butyrate has been recently studied because is important to
      maintain colonic functions and because it has been related with a protective
      effect in colorectal cancer, which is mainly, explained by its potential to
      regulate gene expression by inhibiting enzyme histonedeacetylase (HDAC). Several 
      investigationsshown that SCFAreceptor GPR43 is involved insignal transduction
      mechanisms once they bind to ligands such as butyrate to generate different
      physiological effects in colonocytes. OBJECTIVE: Determine if dietary fiber
      consumption from nopal (Opuntia ficus I.) containing a ratio of soluble-insoluble
      fiber 40/60, has a direct influence on the quantitative expression of
      butyrate-specific receptor GPR43. METHODS: Wistar rats were fed with four
      different diets formulated at different concentrations of dietary fiber of 0, 5, 
      15 and 25% of dietary fiber from opuntia, respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
      The results shown an increase in the expression of GPR43 (93.1%) when rats was
      fed with a 5% fiber diet, using beta-actin as a reference gene. The results of
      this investigation will contribute to determinate the relation of diet with
      intestinal health for the purpose of expanding the knowledge of butyric acid on
      colonic functions.

AB  - The aim of this work was to estimate the intestinal bioaccessibility of
      polyphenols and antioxidant capacity of cactus pear using an in vitro
      gastrointestinal model. The amount of polyphenols released from the food matrix
      by the action of digestive enzymes was about 69-83% in pulp and 0-14% in seeds.
      The rest of polyphenols was associated with indigestible compounds conferring
      antioxidant capacity. The results suggest that these compounds could reach the
      colon and induce healthy effects.

TI  - Chemopreventive effect of cactus Opuntia ficus indica on oxidative stress and
      genotoxicity of aflatoxin B1.
PG  - 73
LID - 10.1186/1743-7075-8-73 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is potent hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic
      agent. In aflatoxicosis, oxidative stress is a common mechanism contributing to
      initiation and progression of hepatic damage. The aim of this work was to
      evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of cactus cladode extract (CCE) on aflatoxin
      B1-induced liver damage in mice by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) level, the
      protein carbonyls generation and the heat shock proteins Hsp 70 and Hsp 27
      expressions in liver. We also looked for an eventual protective effect against
      AFB1-induced genotoxicity as determined by chromosome aberrations test, SOS
      Chromotest and DNA fragmentation assay. We further evaluated the modulation of
      p53, bax and bcl2 protein expressions in liver. METHODS: Adult, healthy balbC
      (20-25 g) male mice were pre-treated by intraperitonial administration of CCE (50
      mg/Kg.b.w) for 2 weeks. Control animals were treated 3 days a week for 4 weeks by
      intraperitonial administration of 250 mug/Kg.b.w AFB1. Animals treated by AFB1
      and CCE were divided into two groups: the first group was administrated CCE 2
      hours before each treatment with AFB1 3 days a week for 4 weeks. The second group
      was administrated without pre-treatment with CCE but this extract was
      administrated 24 hours after each treatment with AFB1 3 days a week for 4 weeks. 
      RESULTS: Our results clearly showed that AFB1 induced significant alterations in 
      oxidative stress markers. In addition, it has a genotoxic potential and it
      increased the expression of pro apoptotic proteins p53 and bax and decreased the 
      expression of bcl2. The treatment of CCE before or after treatment with AFB1,
      showed (i) a total reduction of AFB1 induced oxidative damage markers, (ii) an
      anti-genotoxic effect resulting in an efficient prevention of chromosomal
      aberrations and DNA fragmentation compared to the group treated with AFB1 alone
      (iii) restriction of the effect of AFB1 by differential modulation of the
      expression of p53 which decreased as well as its associated genes such as bax and
      bcl2. CONCLUSION: We concluded that CCE might have a hepatoprotective effect
      against aflatoxicosis in mice, probably acting by promoting the antioxidant
      defence systems.

AB  - The Opuntia ficus indica f. inermis methanolic flowers extract (OMFE) was
      phytochemical studied, in vitro tested for their potential antioxidant activity
      using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), reducing power, linoleic acid
      peroxidation assays and in vivo evaluated for its ability to prevent
      ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats. The OMFE was rich in polysaccharide,
      phenolics and flavonoids contents and exhibited a moderate in vitro antioxidant
      activity when compared with (+)-catechin and ascorbic acid. Pre-treatment with
      OMFE at oral doses 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight was found to provide a
      dose-dependent protection against ethanol-induced gastric ulcer by averting the
      deep necrotic lesions of the gastric epithelium, by preserving normal antioxidant
      enzymes activities, by inhibiting the lipid peroxidation, the oxidation of
      protein and the DNA fragmentation in gastric mucosa. The antiulcerogenic activity
      of OMFE might be due to a possible synergistic antioxidant and
      antihistaminic-like effects.

AB  - Cactus pears are succulent plants of the Cactaceae family adapted to extremely
      arid, hot and cold environments, making them excellent models for the study of
      molecular mechanisms underlying abiotic stress tolerance. Herein, we report a
      directional cDNA library from 12-month-old cladodes of Opuntia streptacantha
      plants subjected to abiotic stresses. A total of 442 clones were sequenced,
      representing 329 cactus pear unigenes, classified into eleven functional
      categories. The most abundant EST (unigen 33) was characterized under abiotic
      stress. This cDNA of 905 bp encodes a SK(3)-type acidic dehydrin of 248 amino
      acids. The OpsDHN1 gene contains an intron inserted within the sequence encoding 
      the S-motif. qRT-PCR analysis shows that the OpsDHN1 transcript is specifically
      accumulated in response to cold stress, and induced by abscisic acid.
      Over-expression of the OpsDHN1 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana leads to enhanced
      tolerance to freezing treatment, suggesting that OpsDHN1 participates in freezing
      stress responsiveness. Generation of the first EST collection for the
      characterization of cactus pear genes constitutes a useful platform for the
      understanding of molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance in Opuntia and other
      CAM plants.

TI  - Agave salmiana plant communities in central Mexico as affected by commercial use.
PG  - 55-63
LID - 10.1007/s00267-011-9759-4 [doi]
AB  - Agave salmiana is a native plant species harvested for the commercial production 
      of mezcal (Agave spirits) in the highlands of central Mexico. The objective of
      this study was to identify vegetation changes in natural communities where A.
      salmiana has been differentially harvested for commercial purposes. Three plant
      community categories were identified in the state of Zacatecas based on their
      history of A. salmiana utilization: short (less than 10 years of use), moderate
      (about 25 years), and long (60 or more years). Species cover, composition, and
      density were evaluated in field surveys by use category. A gradient of vegetation
      structure of the communities parallels the duration of A. salmiana use. A.
      salmiana density was greatest (3,125 plants ha(-1)) in the short-use areas and
      less (892 plants ha(-1)) in the moderate-use areas, associated with markedly
      greater density of shrubs (200%) and Opuntia spp. (50%) in moderate-use areas.
      The main shrubs were Larrea tridentata, Mimosa biuncifera, Jatropha dioica and
      Buddleia scordioides while the main Opuntia species were Opuntia leucotricha and 
      Opuntia robusta. A. salmiana density was least (652 plants ha(-1)) in the
      long-use areas where shrubs were less abundant but Opuntia spp. density was 25%
      higher than in moderate-use areas. We suggest that shrubs may increase with
      moderate use creating an intermediate successional stage that facilitates the
      establishment of Opuntia spp. Long-term Agave use is generating new plant
      communities dominated by Opuntia spp. (nopaleras) as a replacement of the
      original communities dominated by A. salmiana (magueyeras).

AB  - To control growing world population, there is a need for male contraceptive
      methods that are comparable to female contraceptives, but due to lack of
      knowledge or investigation, no sufficient safe and effective contraceptives were 
      developed till now. In the present investigation, the effect of 100% methanol
      extract of Opuntia dillenii phylloclade on reproduction in male rats was studied.
      A first group (I) received vehicle alone to serve as control. The second group
      (II) was further divided into treated and recovery groups, and the plant extract 
      at 50 mg kg body weight(-1) was administered orally for 30 days. Biochemical,
      haematological and histopathological analyses were carried out to reveal the
      effects on reproductive organs in the male rats. The weights of reproductive
      organs were recorded. It was found that the number of fertile males, number of
      inseminated females, number of litters delivered and testosterone levels were
      reduced significantly. Epididymal sperm count and motility were also
      significantly decreased. Biochemical parameters support the antifertility
      activity of O. dillenii i.e. decreases in protein, glycogen content and elevation
      in cholesterol level. Testes and sperm morphology were altered significantly.
      Haematological parameters have not shown any significant changes. It is concluded
      that 100% methanol extract of O. dillenii possesses antifertility effects on male
      reproduction without change in general physiology.

      rats: ameliorative effects of Opuntia vulgaris fruit extract.
PG  - 549-59
LID - 10.1177/0748233711416949 [doi]
AB  - Methanol is primarily metabolized by oxidation to formaldehyde and then to
      formate. These processes are accompanied by formation of superoxide anion and
      hydrogen peroxide. This article reports data on the effect of methanol-induced
      oxidative damage in experimental rats and the role of aqueous extract of Opuntia 
      vulgaris fruit extract (OE) to counteract the toxicity induced by methanol. The
      animals were exposed to methanol at a dose of 2.37 g/kg body weight
      intraperitoneally for 30 days. OE was found to contain large amounts of
      polyphenols and carotenoids and significant antioxidant capacities highlighted by
      scavenging activities for 2,2-diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl. The treatment with
      methanol exhibited a significant increase in serum hepatic and renal biochemical 
      parameters (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline
      phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, urea, and creatinine). Methanol
      intoxication significantly increased hepatic and renal lipid peroxidation
      evaluated by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in treated rats as compared 
      to controls. However, hepatic and renal antioxidant enzymes namely superoxide
      dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were significantly decreased in
      methanol-treated animals as compared to controls. The results concluded that
      treatment with OE prior to methanol intoxication has significant role in
      protecting animals from methanol-induced hepatic and renal histopathological and 
      oxidative damage.

AB  - Four endoglucanase temperature isoforms (T (30), T (50), T (70), and T (90)) were
      identified and purified from the cladodes of the xerophytic plant Opuntia
      vulgaris. These isoforms exhibited optimum catalytic activity at 30 degrees C, 50
      degrees C, 70 degrees C, and 90 degrees C and yielded an apparent molecular mass 
      of 150, 20, 74, and 45 kDa, respectively, on gel filtration chromatography. These
      isoforms were purified 24-, 25-, 29-, and 27-fold with a yield of 15%, 12%, 17%, 
      and 19% and having a specific activity of 120, 125, 144, and 136 U/mg,
      respectively. The thermostable T (70) and T (90) isoforms exhibited optimum
      activity at pH 4.5 and 7 and also yielded a molecular weight of 66 and 36 kDa,
      respectively, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
      electrophoresis. The T (70) had a K (m) of 43 mM and a V (max) of 12.5 mumol
      min(-1) mug(-1) of protein, and the T (90) isoform had a K (m) of 40 mM, with an 
      apparent V (max) of 10 mumol min(-1) mug(-1) of protein. Western blot,
      immunodiffusion, and in vitro inhibition assays established the reactivity of the
      T (90) isoform with polyclonal anti-T (90) antibody raised in rabbit.
      Cross-reactivity of this antibody with the T (70) endoglucanase isoform was also 
      noted.

AB  - The content of ten phenolic compounds present in four different biomass smoke
      materials: rock rose (Cistus monpelienisis), prickly pear (Opuntia ficus indica),
      pine needles (Pinus canariensis), and almonds skin (Prunus dulcis), have been
      evaluated. The sampling method mainly consisted of a trap alkaline solution to
      solubilize the phenols, and was optimized by an experimental design. Average
      sampling efficiencies of 78.1% and an average precision value of 10.6% (as
      relative standard deviation, RSD), were obtained for the selected group of
      phenols. The trapped phenolates were further analyzed by a headspace-single drop 
      microextraction (HS-SDME) procedure, in combination with high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection. The optimum variables for the HS-SDME
      method were: 1-decanol as extractant solvent, 3.5 muL of microdrop volume, 2 mL
      of sample volume, a pH value of 2, saturation of NaCl, an extraction temperature 
      of 60 degrees C, and an extraction time of 25 min. The optimized HS-SDME method
      presented detection limits ranging from 0.35 to 5.8 mug mL(-1), RSD values
      ranging from 0.7 to 7.4%, and an average relative recovery (RR) of 99.8% and an
      average standard deviation of 5.2. The average content of phenolic compounds in
      the biomass materials studied were 70, 161, 206 and 252 mg kg(-1) of biomass for 
      prickly pear, almonds skin, rock rose, and pine needles, respectively. The main
      components of the smokes were vanillin, phenol and methoxyphenols, in all smoking
      materials studied.

AB  - Opuntia is a traditional plant from China with medicinal applications. In this
      experiment, polysaccharides from Opuntia Milpa Alta (MAPs) were analyzed using
      gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) method and result showed that MAPs
      contained mannose (6.37%), rhamnose (14.94%), xylose (1.99%), arabinose (24.07%),
      galactose (38.25%), ribose (2.63%) and glucose (11.48%). The neuroprotective
      effects of MAPs were evaluated at the mechanistic level in vitro models of
      cerebral ischemic injury. In vitro oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) model, MAPs
      (0.5 mug/ml, 5 mug/ml, 50 mug/ml) effectively increased cell viability by methyl 
      thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, inhibited cell cytotoxicity by lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, reduced neuronal cell death, suppressed the production
      of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased of intracellular free
      Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)), and reduced extracellular glutamate level.
      Therefore, MAPs might prevent intracellular calcium overload and decreased
      glutamate excitotoxicity, both of which can cause neuronal injury and death in
      vitro models of cerebral ischemic injury.

PG  - 479-87
LID - 10.1016/j.nutres.2011.05.002 [doi]
AB  - The Opuntia humifusa stem (OHSt) contains high levels of antioxidants including
      vitamin C, flavonoids, and polyphenols that may prove beneficial in treating
      diabetes mellitus. The objective of this study was to examine the hypothesis that
      intake of the OHSt regulates blood glucose levels and hypolipidemic responses in 
      rats with diabetes mellitus induced by injection of streptozotocin. Forty
      Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks of age) were assigned to 5 groups: normal control,
      rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM), DM treated with OHSt 150
      mg/kg per day, DM treated with OHSt 250 mg/kg per day, and DM treated with OHSt
      500 mg/kg per day. Powdered OHSt was suspended in distilled water and
      administered orally through the sonde once daily. After 7 weeks of treatment, the
      fasting blood glucose and triglyceride levels of the OHSt groups were
      significantly lower when compared with the DM group (P < .05). Treatment with the
      OHSt also resulted in a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol and
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < .05). Decreases in both total
      cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were accompanied by a
      significant increase in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < .05).
      Furthermore, levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase
      were significantly lower in the OHSt groups than in the DM group (P < .05). In
      addition, a significant increase in relative beta cell volume of pancreas was
      observed in rats treated with 500 mg/kg of OHSt when compared with the untreated 
      DM rats (P < .05). The overall results suggest that the OHSt possesses potential 
      hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate different entomopathogenic fungal isolates against the cactus
      weevil Metamasius spinolae under laboratory and field conditions, and select an
      isolate to be used as a tool in the management of this insect pest. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Four experiments were carried out. The effect of temperature on the in
      vitro growth of eight isolates of entomopathogenic fungi (two Metarhizium
      anisopliae and six Beauveria bassiana) was assessed. The susceptibility of adult 
      M. spinolae to the same isolates was evaluated. Using three selected isolates,
      the interaction between susceptibility and sex of the insect was studied.
      Finally, a field experiment was carried out to evaluate infection of adult M.
      spinolae by the same three isolates under natural abiotic conditions. Overall,
      growth rate was greatest at 25 degrees C for all the isolates. In vitro growth of
      M. anisopliae was greater than B. bassiana. Mortality of adult M. spinolae was
      greater when inoculated with B. bassiana compared with isolates of M. anisopliae.
      Susceptibility had no interaction with the sex of the insect. The proportion of
      insects succumbing to infection was smaller when incubated under field conditions
      than when incubated under laboratory conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The experiments
      described here showed a complex interaction between entomopathogenic fungi and M.
      spinolae, and these data allows us to select isolate Bb107 as a first step
      towards its use in the management of this pest insect. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF
      THE STUDY: Our results showed that entomopathogenic fungi can be used for the
      control of M. spinolae, which may help reduce the use of chemical insecticides
      and, therefore, the exposure of Opuntia ficus-indica producers to pesticides.

TI  - Conserved and divergent rhythms of crassulacean acid metabolism-related and core 
      clock gene expression in the cactus Opuntia ficus-indica.
PG  - 1978-89
LID - 10.1104/pp.111.179275 [doi]
AB  - The cactus Opuntia ficus-indica is a constitutive Crassulacean acid metabolism
      (CAM) species. Current knowledge of CAM metabolism suggests that the enzyme
      phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase (PPCK) is circadian regulated at the
      transcriptional level, whereas phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), malate
      dehydrogenase (MDH), NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), and pyruvate phosphate dikinase
      (PPDK) are posttranslationally controlled. As little transcriptomic data are
      available from obligate CAM plants, we created an expressed sequence tag database
      derived from different organs and developmental stages. Sequences were assembled,
      compared with sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
      nonredundant database for identification of putative orthologs, and mapped using 
      Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Orthology and Gene Ontology. We
      identified genes involved in circadian regulation and CAM metabolism for
      transcriptomic analysis in plants grown in long days. We identified stable
      reference genes for quantitative polymerase chain reaction and found that
      OfiSAND, like its counterpart in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and OfiTUB
      are generally appropriate standards for use in the quantification of gene
      expression in O. ficus-indica. Three kinds of expression profiles were found:
      transcripts of OfiPPCK oscillated with a 24-h periodicity; transcripts of the
      light-active OfiNADP-ME and OfiPPDK genes adapted to 12-h cycles, while
      transcript accumulation patterns of OfiPEPC and OfiMDH were arrhythmic.
      Expression of the circadian clock gene OfiTOC1, similar to Arabidopsis,
      oscillated with a 24-h periodicity, peaking at night. Expression of OfiCCA1 and
      OfiPRR9, unlike in Arabidopsis, adapted best to a 12-h rhythm, suggesting that
      circadian clock gene interactions differ from those of Arabidopsis. Our results
      indicate that the evolution of CAM metabolism could be the result of modified
      circadian regulation at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.

      at varied ages in an organic harvest.
PG  - 1287-95
LID - 10.3390/ijerph8051287 [doi]
AB  - Opuntia ficus indica, also known as prickly pads, are an important part of the
      human diet and are also used as forage for livestock. This is an interesting
      vegetable due the environmental conditions in which it grows and its resistance
      to climatic extremes; however, little is known about its nutritional properties, 
      especially in the later stages of maturity. The objective of this study was to
      determine the composition of organic prickly pads (Opuntia ficus indica) at
      differing stages of growth maturity. Chemical proximate analysis and mineral
      constituent analysis at different maturation stages were carried out in this
      investigation. As a result, older prickly pads were found to be an important
      source of nutritional components such as calcium.

TI  - [Mixed drink consisting of guava (Psidium guajava. L) and forrageira palm
      (Opuntia ficus-indica): development and acceptability].
PG  - 285-90
AB  - Nowadays, in the beverage industry, the mixture of products became an alternative
      to increase the nutritional value or even to develop new flavors in the
      formulation of mixed drinks. The objective of this work was to develop a mixed
      drink of forrageira palm with guava. Four formulations with different palm
      concentrations and soluble solids were evaluated, keeping the concentration of
      guava stable. The products were submitted to chemical characterization (pH,
      soluble solids, titratable acidity, vitamin C) sensory evaluation (flavor, color,
      body and global acceptance) and microbiological analysis (total coliforms and
      thermotolerants, Salmonella and Estaphylococcus aureus). All the samples were
      well accepted in the sensory aspect and did not present any significant
      difference (p < 0.5) among them. And the level of acceptance ranged from "I liked
      it slightly." to "I liked it moderately." for all the evaluated features. The
      formulated mixed drink was according to the chemical and microbiological patterns
      set by Brazilian laws, except for the pH that was above the ideal level for
      industrialized products. In respect of the microbiological analysis, none of the 
      formulations presented microorganisms. The results showed that the elaborated
      product is in accordance with the identity and quality standards established for 
      beverages. It also has a good sensory acceptance, which makes it a product with
      high potential for industrialization.

TI  - Comparative analyses of total phenols, antioxidant activity, and flavonol
      glycoside profile of cladode flours from different varieties of Opuntia spp.
PG  - 7054-61
LID - 10.1021/jf200944y [doi]
AB  - The phenolic, flavonoid, and antioxidant contents of methanol extracts of nine
      samples of Mexican cactus ( Opuntia spp.) cladodes processed into flours were
      studied. Opuntia undulata contained the highest amount of phenols [905.08 +/-
      64.51 mug of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g]. The oxygen radical absorbance
      capacity (ORAC) of the cladode flour extracts indicated that Opuntia robusta var.
      Gavia [738.8 +/- 89.9 mumol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g] contained the highest
      antioxidant capacity. ORAC values significantly correlated to total phenols but
      not to flavonoid contents and were comparable to cranberries and blackberries.
      Glycosidic forms of isorhamnetin and kaempferol were identified via
      high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array (HPLC-PDA) and HPLC-mass 
      spectrometry (MS), with isorhamnetin being the most abundant flavonol in all
      samples, except for Opuntia lindheimeri . The effectiveness of acid hydrolysis
      varied among species because of the different flavonol profiles. For some
      varieties, the triglycosidic forms were partially acid-hydrolyzed, giving an
      increase in the content of diglycosides. Optimization of hydrolysis for each
      species is required to estimate the total amount of each flavonol.

TI  - Drought-stress-induced up-regulation of CAM in seedlings of a tropical cactus,
      Opuntia elatior, operating predominantly in the C3 mode.
PG  - 4037-42
LID - 10.1093/jxb/err106 [doi]
AB  - Immediately after unfolding, cotyledons of the tropical platyopuntoid cactus,
      Opuntia elatior Mill., exhibited a C(3)-type diel CO(2) exchange pattern
      characterized by net CO(2) uptake in the light. Significant nocturnal increases
      in titratable acidity typical of crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) were not
      detected at this early developmental stage. As cotyledons matured and the first
      cladode (flattened stem) developed, features of CAM were observed and the
      magnitude of CAM increased. Nonetheless, in well-watered seedlings up to 10 cm
      tall, C(3) photosynthetic CO(2) fixation in the light remained the major pathway 
      of carbon fixation. Reduced soil water availability led to an up-regulation of
      net dark CO(2) fixation and greater nocturnal increases in tissue acidity,
      consistent with facultative CAM. These observations demonstrate that C(3)
      photosynthesis, drought-stress-related facultative CAM, and developmentally
      controlled constitutive CAM can all contribute to the early growth of O. elatior.
      The strong C(3) component and facultative CAM features expressed in young O.
      elatior contrast with mature plants in which obligate CAM is the major pathway of
      carbon acquisition.

TI  - Distribution and habitat in Mexico of Dactylopius Costa (Hemiptera:
      Dactylopiidae) and their cacti hosts (Cactaceae: Opuntioideae).
PG  - 62-71
LID - S1519-566X2011000100009 [pii]
AB  - The distribution pattern of species of the genus Dactylopius Costa in Mexico was 
      analyzed in relation to the distribution of their host plants (subfamily
      Opuntioideae) to evaluate the specificity of the insect-host association. The
      distribution of Dactylopius currently recognized is narrower than that of its
      hosts and probably is not representative. Therefore, a broader distribution of
      the Dactylopius species in correspondence with those of their hosts was
      hypothesized. Insects and their hosts were collected and georeferenced in 14
      states of Mexico from 2005 to 2007. The distribution areas, maps, and habitat
      characteristics of Dactylopius, Opuntia sensu stricto, Nopalea and Cylindropuntia
      were determined on the basis of field collections and examination of museum
      collections. This information was complemented with information from the
      exhaustive examination of microscope slides from a local insect collection,
      plants from local herbaria, and literature reviews. The current distribution of
      the genus Dactylopius and its hosts included 22 and 25 states of Mexico,
      respectively, and Dactylopius had a continuous distribution according to its
      hosts, broader than recognized hitherto. The new georeferenced records of the
      five Mexican Dactylopius species are reported. Insects with morphological
      characteristics of D. confusus combined with those of D. salmianus were
      identified, as well as insects with characteristics of D. opuntiae combined with 
      those of D. salmianus. These records suggest that the number of local Dactylopius
      species could be higher than previously thought or that possible new processes of
      hybridization between native and introduced species may be occurring.

      effects of Opuntia vulgaris fruit extract.
PG  - 1963-71
LID - 10.1177/0960327111403175 [doi]
AB  - The ameliorative effects of Opuntia vulgaris fruit extract (OE) were evaluated
      against methanol-induced haematological and biochemical toxicity in rats. The
      methanol-induced haematological and biochemical perturbation significantly
      decreased the levels of red blood cell (RBC), haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Ht),
      serum total protein and increased glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels
      in serum. Treatment of rats with methanol significantly increased lipid
      peroxidation (LPO) level and decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase
      (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in erythrocytes. OE
      treatment could increase significantly the levels of RBC, Hb, Ht and total
      protein, and decrease glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum, and 
      increase the activities of SOD, CAT and GPx in erythrocytes, when compared with
      methanol-treated group. Spleen histopathology showed that OE could significantly 
      reduce the incidence of spleen lesion induced by methanol. These results
      suggested that OE could exhibit a potential source of natural antioxidants
      against methanol-induced haematological and biochemical disruption in rats. The
      protective effects of OE may be due to the modulation of antioxidant enzymes
      activities and inhibition of LPO.

      crude protein, ash, and crude fiber, peroxide value, saponification value,
      acidity, relative density and refractive index) of prickly pear seed and
      corresponding oil were determined. The mineral contents (Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Na,
      P, Mn and Zn) of samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic
      emission spectrometry. Minerals determined were: calcium 471.2 mg/kg, potassium
      532.7 mg/kg, magnesium 117.3 mg/kg, phosphorus 1,627.5 mg/kg and natrium 71.3
      mg/kg. The fatty acid profiles of seed oil from the Opuntia ficus indica were
      analyzed by gas chromatography. Linoleic acid was established as the major fatty 
      acid (61.01%), followed by oleic (25.52%) and palmitic (12.23%) acids. Both
      myristic, stearic and arachidonic acids were detected in O. ficus indica seed oil
      in low amounts. As a result, O. ficus indica seeds are an important source of
      natural fiber and, given its high linoleic acid content, its oil can be used as a
      nutraceutic agent.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of indicaxanthin on mouse ileal contractility: analysis of the
      mechanism of action.
PG  - 200-5
LID - 10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.02.034 [doi]
AB  - Recently, we have showed that indicaxanthin, the yellow betalain pigment abundant
      in the fruit of Opuntia ficus indica, has remarkable spasmolytic effects on the
      intestinal contractility in vitro. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to 
      investigate the mechanism of action underlying the observed response. We used
      organ bath technique to record the mechanical activity of the mouse ileum
      longitudinal muscle and ELISA to measure the levels of cAMP. Indicaxanthin
      induced inhibitory effects on spontaneous mechanical activity, which were
      unaffected by indomethacin, a non-selective inhibitor of cycloxygenase;
      1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, a selective inhibitor of nitric
      oxide-dependent guanylyl cyclase; 2'5'dideoxyadenosine, an adenylyl cyclase
      inhibitor; and zaprinast, a selective inhibitor of the cGMP phosphodiesterase
      isoenzyme. Indicaxanthin effects were reduced significantly in the presence of
      3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a non selective inhibitor of
      phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Indicaxanthin and IBMX significantly reduced the
      carbachol-evoked contractions and the joint application of both drugs did not
      produce any additive effect. Indicaxanthin and IBMX increased the inhibitory
      effects of forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, and the joint application of
      both drugs did not produce any additive effect. Indicaxanthin, contrarily to
      IBMX, did not affect the inhibitory action of sodium nitroprusside, a soluble
      guanylyl cyclase activator. Indicaxanthin increased both basal and
      forskolin-induced cAMP content of mouse ileal muscle. The present data show that 
      indicaxanthin reduces the contractility of ileal longitudinal muscle by
      inhibition of PDEs and increase of cAMP concentration and raise the possibility
      of using indicaxanthin in the treatment of motility disorders, such as abdominal 
      cramps.

AB  - Sand flies have been reported feeding on various plant organs including stems,
      leaves, and flowers but the attraction of sand flies to sugar-rich fruits has
      received little attention. In this study, we tested 24 commercially available
      fruits for their attractiveness to sand flies, and found that the top three
      attractive fruits were nectarine (Prunus persica var. nectarina), cactus fruit,
      (Opuntia ficus-indica), and guava (Psidium guajava). These fruits were fed upon
      equally by both males and females. There were slight differences in the order of 
      preference to the less-attractive fruits by males and females, but these were not
      statistically significant. The knowledge of fruit preference may help to improve 
      existing methods that use plant phytochemicals to attract and kill biting flies.

TI  - The influence of historical geneflow, bathymetry and distribution patterns on the
      population genetics of morphologically diverse Galapagos' Opuntia echios.
PG  - 315-25
LID - 10.1007/s00239-011-9434-7 [doi]
AB  - Throughout history, remote archipelagos have repeatedly been designated natural
      laboratories to study evolutionary processes. The extensive, geographically
      structured, morphological variation within Galapagos' Opuntia cacti has been
      presumed to be another example of how such processes shape diversity. However,
      recent genetic studies on speciation and potential effects of plasticity within
      this system failed to confirm earlier classification and hypothesized radiation
      on both global and single island levels. Detailed population genetic information,
      however, is crucial in conserving these semi-arid ecosystem keystone species. In 
      this article, we re-evaluate the genetics of Opuntia echios inhabiting one of the
      most taxon rich places on the archipelago: Santa Cruz and its surrounding
      satellite islands, using microsatellite data. Our analysis revealed high genetic 
      variability within all sampled locations, providing little support for the
      hypothesis of clonal reproduction. Inter-island gene flow patterns appear to be
      largely influenced by bathymetry and sea levels during last ice ages. Although O.
      echios from Seymour Norte are morphologically recognized as being a separate
      taxon, Daphne Major's cacti are the most differentiated. In addition, we found a 
      potential barrier for gene flow along the ring-like distribution of Opuntias at
      the western side of Santa Cruz, suggesting potential links with geology.

      honeydew.
PG  - 45-9
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.01.009 [doi]
AB  - Sugar is the main source of energy for the activities of mosquitoes; however,
      information on the vital sugar feeding of Aedes albopictus in the field is scanty
      and often anecdotal. Using glue traps and baits, we evaluated the attraction of
      Ae. albopictus to 28 different, potential sugar sources. Control traps were
      baited with either sugar-water solution or water alone, and since there was no
      significant difference between these controls, the water control was used as the 
      standard for comparison. The total catch amounted to 1347 females and 1127 males.
      An attraction index (mean number of mosquitoes attracted to the baits/mean number
      of mosquitoes attracted to the control) was used to compare the relative
      attraction of the baits. The attraction index of significantly attractive baits
      ranged from 2.5 to 50.0 and the index of others ranged from 0.50 to 2.75. None of
      the baits were repellent. Significantly high attraction was observed for four of 
      six ornamental flowers (Tamarix chinensis, Vitex agnus-castus, Polygonum
      baldchuanicum, Buddleja davidii), four of eleven wild flowers (Prosopis farcta,
      Ziziphus spina-christi, Polygonum equisetiforme, Ceratonia siliqua), the only
      tested seed pod when damaged and fermenting (C. siliqua), and all five of the
      tested fruits: Opuntia ficus indica (sabra), Ficus carica (fig), Punica granatum 
      (pomegranate, damaged), Eriobotyra japonica (loquat), and Rubus sanctus
      (raspberry). Unlike damaged, fermenting carob seed pods and pomegranates, the
      fresh fruits were not attractive. Attraction to foliage soiled with honeydew
      excretion of three different aphid species was also not significant. The
      potential to use attractive sugar sources for mosquito control is discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the most effective hypoglycemic component 
      of polysaccharides from Opuntia dillenii Haw. by preliminary screening and to
      specifically study the antidiabetic effects of O. dillenii polysaccharide
      (ODP)-Ia in mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Three kinds of ODPs 
      - ODP-Ia, ODP-Ib, and ODP-II' - were isolated by using an ultrasonic extraction
      method and diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sepharose fast-flow column chromatography.
      The mice were administered ODPs for 3 weeks. Gavage administration of ODP-Ia
      significantly decreased (P<0.05) their intake of food and water; the fasting
      levels of blood glucose (BG), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), plasma
      urea nitrogen (PUN), and malondialdehyde (MDA); and the activity of
      glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase). In contrast, it significantly increased
      (P<0.05) the body weights, hepatic glycogen (HG) levels, high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and the hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
      glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in diabetic mice. However, ODP-Ia did
      not significantly increase insulin levels in the mice with STZ-induced diabetes. 
      We propose that ODP-Ia exerts its antihyperglycemic effect by protecting the
      liver from peroxidation damage and by maintaining tissue function, thereby
      improving the sensitivity and response of target cells in diabetic mice to
      insulin.

TI  - Ethnobotanical survey of medicinal plants commonly used by Kani tribals in
      Tirunelveli hills of Western Ghats, India.
PG  - 851-64
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2011.01.029 [doi]
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: For thousands of years, medicinal plants have
      played an important role throughout the world in treating and preventing a
      variety of diseases. Kani tribal people in Tirunelveli hills still depend on
      medicinal plants and most of them have a general knowledge of medicinal plants
      which are used for first aid remedies, to treat cough, cold, fever, headache,
      poisonous bites and some simple ailments. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was
      initiated with an aim to identify traditional healers who are practicing herbal
      medicine among the Kani tribals in Tirunelveli hills of Western Ghats, India and 
      quantitatively document their indigenous knowledge on the utilization of
      medicinal plants particularly most common ethnomedicinal plants. METHODS: Field
      study was carried out over a period of 4 years in Tirunelveli hills. The
      ethnomedicinal information was collected through interviews among the Kani
      traditional healers. The collected data were analyzed through use value (UV),
      informant consensus factor (F(ic)), fidelity level (FL) and relative importance
      (RI). RESULTS: A total of 90 species of plants distributed in 83 genera belonging
      to 52 families were identified as commonly used ethnomedicinal plants by the Kani
      traditional healers in Tirunelveli hills for the treatment of 65 types of
      ailments. These ailments were categorized into 15 ailment categories based on the
      body systems treated. Leaves were the most frequently used plant parts and most
      of the medicines were prepared in the form of paste and administered orally.
      F(ic) values of the present study indicated that there was a high agreement in
      the use of plants in the treatment of jaundice and diabetes among the users.
      Dermatological infections/diseases and gastro-intestinal disorders had highest
      use-reports and 29 species of plants had the highest fidelity level of 100%. The 
      most important species according to their use value were Gymneme sylvestre
      (2.00), Melia azedarach, Murraya koenigii, Syzygium cumini and Terminalia chebula
      (1.83). CONCLUSION: As a result of the present study we can recommend the plants 
      Alpinia galanga, Azadirachta indica, Calophyllum inophyllum, Gymnema sylvestre,
      Leucas aspera, M. azedarach, Mollugo nudicaulis, Ocimum tenuiflorum, S. cumini,
      T. chebula and Tribulus terrestris (with high UV and RI values), Bambusa
      arundinacea, Datura metel, Evolvulus nummularius, Opuntia dillenii and Physalis
      minima (newly reported claims with highest FL) for further ethnopharmacological
      studies for the discovery of potential new drugs.

      (Opuntia ficus-indica) cladodes after convective drying.
PG  - 1001-5
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.4271 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The process of convective drying was evaluated in terms of the
      bioactive compounds contained in nopal samples before and after dehydration.
      Total polyphenol, flavonoid, flavonol, carotene and ascorbic acid contents were
      determined in undehydrated and dehydrated samples. Two drying temperatures (45
      and 65 degrees C) and two air flow rates (3 and 5 m s(-1) ) were evaluated. The
      rheology of samples under the best drying conditions was also studied, since it
      provides important information regarding processing (mixing, flow processing) as 
      well as the sensory attributes (texture) of rehydrated samples. RESULTS:
      Non-Newtonian shear-thinning behaviour was observed for samples dried at 45
      degrees C, while samples dried at 65 degrees C showed shear-thickening behaviour,
      possibly caused by thermal chain scission of high-molecular-weight components.
      CONCLUSION: The best conditions for bioactive compound preservation were a drying
      temperature of 45 degrees C and an air flow rate of 3 m s(-1) , resulting in
      40.97 g phenols, 23.41 g flavonoids, 0.543 g beta-carotene and 0.2815 g ascorbic 
      acid kg(-1) sample as shown in table 3.

      Opuntia vulgaris mill.
PG  - 593-603
LID - 10.1007/s12010-011-9160-z [doi]
AB  - Thermophilic xylose isomerase from the xerophytic eukaryote Opuntia vulgaris can 
      serve as a good alternate source of enzyme for use in the production of high
      fructose corn syrup. The existence of two temperature stable isoforms having
      optimal activity at temperatures 70 degrees C (T(70)) and 90 degrees C (T(90)),
      respectively, is reported here. These isoforms were purified to homogeneity using
      column chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic techniques. Only
      the T(90) isoform was subjected to full biochemical characterization thereafter. 
      The purified T(90) isoform was capable of converting glucose to fructose with
      high efficiency under the assay conditions. The enzyme at pH 7.5 exhibited a
      preference to yield the forward isomerization reaction. The melting temperature
      of the native enzyme was determined to be 90 degrees C employing differential
      scanning colorimetery. Thermostability of the enzyme protein was established
      through temperature-related denaturation kinetic studies. It is suggested that

PG  - 289-301

AB  - Diabetes is usually associated with inflammation. Inflammation contributes to the
      development of diabetes. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) play an important
      role in lowering blood glucose and controlling inflammation. Many studies show
      that TCM with hypoglycaemic effects, for example Radix Astragali, Radix
      Rehmanniae, Radix Trichosanthis, Panax Ginseng, Fructus Schisandrae, Radix
      Ophiopogonis, Rhizoma Anemarrhenae, Radix Puerariae, Fructus Lycii, Poria,
      Rhizoma Coptidis, Rhizoma Dioscoreae, Rhizoma Polygonati, Radix Salviae
      Miltiorrhizae, Radix Glycyrrhizae, Semen Trigonellae, Momordica charantia, Allium
      sativum, Opuntia stricta, Aloe vera, Cortex Cinnamomi, Rhizoma Curcumae Longae,
      and so on, have nearly independent anti-inflammatory action. Antihyperglycaemic
      compounds, for example berberine, puerarin, quercetin, ferulic acid,
      astragaloside IV, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, resveratrol, tetrandrine,
      glycyrrhizin, emodin and baicalin, used in TCM also have anti-inflammatory
      effects. These studies suggest that TCM might exert hypoglycaemic effects that
      are partly mediated by the anti-inflammatory mechanisms. However, small amounts
      of TCM with potent anti-inflammatory action does not have any hypoglycaemic
      effect. This indirectly indicates that diabetes may be a low-grade inflammatory
      disease and potent regulation of inflammatory mediators may not be required.
      Studies of TCM add new evidences, which indicate that diabetes may be an
      inflammatory disease and slight or moderate inhibition of inflammation might be
      useful to prevent the development of diabetes. Through this review, we aim to
      develop more perspectives to indicate that diabetes may be an inflammatory
      disease and diverse TCM may share a common antidiabetic property:
      anti-inflammatory action. Further studies should focus on and validate
      inflammation-regulating targets of TCM that may be involved in inhibiting the
      development of diabetes.

TI  - [In vitro study of the litholytic effects of herbal extracts on cystine urinary
      calculi].
PG  - 40-7
LID - 10.1016/j.purol.2010.05.009 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: cystine stones represent 1% of urinary calculi in adults and 10% in
      children and are especially recurrent and resistant to ESWL. Medical therapy is
      often efficient but often poorly tolerated. In Morocco, various plants, Herniaria
      hirsuta, Opuntia ficus-indica, Zea mays and Ammi visnaga are proposed against
      nephrolithiasis. We assessed the effect of plant extracts on the disolution of
      cystine stones in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHOD: an extract of each plant was
      prepared by infusion of two grams of powdered plants during 30 minutes in 100ml
      of a boiled NaCl 9 g/L aqueous solution. Each extract was then filtered and
      thereafter set in a flask containing a cystine stone. The medium was maintained
      under stirring during 8 weeks. NaCl 9 g/L solution and sodium citrate 3 mmol/L
      solution were used as controls. At the end of each two weeks period, the stone
      was removed from the experimental medium and weighted after a 16h drying period
      at 40 degrees C. RESULTS: after 8 weeks of experiment, stone dissolution was
      complete for all herbal extracts, and was earlier in the presence of Zea mays (4 
      weeks) or of Ammi visnaga (6 weeks) by comparison to only 18 +/- 8 and 20 +/- 1.5
      % for citrate and NaCl solutions, respectively. CONCLUSION: the studied herbal
      extracts were efficient for dissolving cystine stones, probably resulting from
      the formation of complexes between cystine and polyhydroxylated molecules present
      in the extracts. These results, to be confirmed in vivo, underline the potential 
      interest of the plant extracts to treat cystine stones.

TI  - Seaweeds as a source of lead compounds for the development of new antiplasmodial 
      drugs from South East coast of India.
PG  - 47-52
LID - 10.1007/s00436-010-2219-x [doi]
AB  - The problems of resistant lines of Plasmodium falciparum are escalating. Twelve
      seaweeds species belong to five different families (Sargassaceae, Gracilariaceae,
      Hypneaceae, Corallinaceae and Halimedaceae) were collected from Mandapam coastal 
      area, and the seaweeds extracts were tested for in vitro antiplasmodial activity 
      against P. falciparum. Among the tested seaweeds, Gracilaria verrucosa (IC(50)
      5.55 mug.ml(-1)) and Hypnea espera (IC(50) 8.94 mug.ml(-1)) showed good
      antiplasmodial activity, and these results are comparable with positive controls 
      such as artemether (IC(50) 4.09 mug.ml(-1)) and chloroquine (IC(50) 19.59
      mug.ml(-1)), respectively. Turbinaria conoides, Sargassum myriocystem, Hypnea
      valentiae and Jania rubens extracts showed IC(50) values between 5 to 50
      mug.ml(-1). Sargassum sp., Turbinaria decurrens and Halimeda gracilis extracts
      showed IC(50) values between 50 to 100 mug.ml(-1). Gracilaria corticata, Jania
      adherens and Halimeda opuntia extracts showed IC(50) value of more than 100
      mug.ml(-1). Statistical analysis reveals that significant in vitro antiplasmodial
      activity (P < 0.05) was observed between the concentrations and time of exposure.
      The chemical injury to erythrocytes was also carried out, and it shows that no
      morphological changes in erythrocytes by the ethanolic extract of seaweeds
      extracts after 48 h of incubation. The in vitro antiplasmodial activity might be 
      due to the presence of sugars, proteins, phenols and carboxylic acid in the
      ethanolic extracts of seaweeds. It is concluded from the present study that the
      ethanolic extracts of seaweeds of G. verrucosa and Hypnea espera possess lead
      compounds for development of antiplasmodial drugs.

TI  - Chemical composition and antidiabetic activity of Opuntia Milpa Alta extracts.
PG  - 2869-79
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.201000077 [doi]
AB  - Three new compounds, 1-3, and 20 known compounds were isolated from the AcOEt and
      BuOH extract of edible Opuntia Milpa Alta. The petroleum ether extract was
      examined by GC and MS. A total of 26 compounds were identified, representing
      95.6% of the total extract, phytosterol (36.03%) being the most abundant
      component, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (18.57%) represented the second
      largest group, followed by phytol (12.28%), palmitic acid, palmitate (13.54%),
      vitamin E (4.51%), and other compounds (7.47%). The effects of various extracts
      from edible Opuntia Milpa Alta (petroleum ether extract, AcOEt extract, BuOH
      extract, aqueous extract, H(2)O parts) and the positive control (received
      dimethylbiguanide) were tested on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. The
      results indicated that all the treatment groups could significantly decrease
      blood glucose levels in STZ-induced diabetic mice compared to the model control
      group (P<0.01), except the aqueous extract group (P<0.05). Especially, the
      petroleum ether extract group and the positive control group showed remarkable
      decrease of blood glucose levels. Taken together, the results indicate that the
      petroleum ether extract is the major hypoglycemic part in edible Opuntia Milpa
      Alta, which may be developed to a potential natural hypoglycemic functional
      ingredient.

TI  - Are fungi important for breaking seed dormancy in desert species? Experimental
      evidence in Opuntia streptacantha (Cactaceae).
PG  - 154-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1438-8677.2010.00333.x [doi]
AB  - Seeds of Opuntia spp. have physiological dormancy; they need a period of
      after-ripening to break dormancy, and the embryos have low growth potential. We
      evaluated the combined effects of seed age and presence of fungi on the testa on 
      germination of Opuntia streptacantha, an abundant species in the Chihuahuan
      Desert (Mexico), assuming that older seeds have broken seed dormancy and fungi
      can reduce mechanical resistance to germination. In a preliminary experiment, we 
      found no germination of 9-year-old (1998) and freshly collected (2007) seeds.
      However, we obtained 67% and 27% germination from 9-year-old and fresh
      non-sterilized seeds, respectively, and found fungi growing on the testa of all
      germinated seeds. Two fungal strains were isolated and identified using ribosomal
      internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis: Penicillium chrysogenum and 
      Phoma sp. In a second experiment, we inoculated seeds with strains of P.
      chrysogenum and Phoma sp., as well as Trichoderma koningii and binucleate
      Rhizoctonia (Gto17S2), to evaluate their ability to break seed dormancy. Seeds
      inoculated with P. chrysogenum, Phoma sp. and T. koningii had higher germination 
      than controls for both seed ages, but germination was higher in older seeds.
      Scanning electron microscopy showed that these fungi eroded the funiculus,
      reducing its resistance. Binucleate Rhizoctonia did not lead to germination and
      controls had almost no germination. Our results strongly indicate that fungi are 
      involved in breaking seed dormancy of O. streptacantha, and that the effect of
      fungi on seeds is species-specific.

LID - 10.1016/j.ctim.2010.09.007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of ethnicity as a predictor of the use of
      complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among patients with diabetes. DESIGN
      AND SETTINGS: A 16-item questionnaire investigating CAM use was distributed among
      patients attending the Taking Control of Your Diabetes (TCOYD) educational
      conferences during 2004-2006. Six TCOYD were held across the United States.
      Information of diabetes status and sociodemographic data was collected. CAM use
      was identified as pharmacologic (herbs and vitamins) and nonpharmacologic CAMs
      (e.g., prayer, yoga, and acupuncture). RESULTS: The prevalence of pharmacologic
      and non-pharmacologic CAMs among 806 participants with diabetes patients was
      81.9% and 80.3%, respectively. Overall, CAM prevalence was similar for Caucasians
      (94.2%), African Americans (95.5%), Hispanics (95.6%) and Native Americans
      (95.2%) and lower in Pacific Islanders/others (83.9%) and Asians (87.8%).
      Pharmacologic CAM prevalence was positively associated with education (p=0.001). 
      The presence of diabetes was a powerful predictor of CAM use. Several significant
      ethnic differences were observed in specific forms of CAM use. Hispanics reported
      using frequently prickly pear (nopal) to complement their diabetes treatment
      while Caucasians more commonly used multivitamins. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with
      CAM widely used in persons with diabetes. Ethnic group differences determine a
      variety of practices, reflecting groups' cultural preferences. Future research is
      needed to clarify the perceived reasons for CAM use among patients with diabetes 
      in clinical practice and the health belief system associated with diabetes by
      ethnic group.

AB  - In recent years a species of Hesperolabops has become a problem as a pest of
      nopalitos, Opuntia ficus-indica, in Milpa Alta, in the south of Mexico City,
      which is the most important production region of this vegetable in the country. A
      survey of Hesperolabops in Milpa Alta has resulted in the first report of
      Hesperolabops nigriceps Reuter. This occurrence should be monitored and
      considered in future studies in order to avoid misidentification of Hesperolabops
      spp. Kirkaldy native populations there, and to avoid the confusion of the damage 
      that may be caused on O. ficus-indica.

TI  - Anti-hyperglycemic effect of Opuntia streptacantha Lem.
PG  - 940-3
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2010.11.022 [doi]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: This experiment studied two extracts of Opuntia streptacantha, 
      a plant used by the Mexican population to treat type 2 diabetes, in different
      assays to contribute to the understanding of the hypoglycemic mechanism of this
      plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two different extracts were prepared and tested:
      the first extract was a filtrate of the traditional liquefied extract (LE)
      preparation of the cladode; and the second filtrate extract (FE) is a filtered
      sample of the first. Both extracts contained a newly identified compound for
      Opuntia (4-hydroxy)-phenyl acetic acid derivate, they were tested on
      streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats in a series of two tests. The first test was
      performed to confirm if STZ-diabetic rats presented a hypoglycemic effect after
      administration of the extracts (LE 135 mg/kg and FE 27 mg/kg). In the second
      experiment, the extracts were administered before an oral glucose tolerance test 
      (OGTT) to confirm if they have an anti-hyperglycemic effect (LE 135 mg/kg, FE 12 
      and 27 mg/kg). RESULTS: The extracts administered to STZ-diabetic rats did not
      produce a significant hypoglycemic effect compared to the control group, while
      the same extracts administered before an OGTT produced an anti-hyperglycemic
      effect compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The filtered, traditional LE
      of the cladode of Opuntia streptacantha produces an anti-hyperglycemic effect
      when administered before a glucose challenge, and this anti-hyperglycemic effect 
      is maintained after filtering the extract. Administration of both plants can
      improve glycemic control by blocking the hepatic glucose output, especially in
      the fasting state. These data support the traditional use of the plants as "agua 
      de uso", a cold infusion of the plant consumed over the course of a day.

TI  - Selenium accumulation, distribution, and speciation in spineless prickly pear
      cactus: a drought- and salt-tolerant, selenium-enriched nutraceutical fruit crop 
      for biofortified foods.
PG  - 315-27
LID - 10.1104/pp.110.162867 [doi]
AB  - The organ-specific accumulation, spatial distribution, and chemical speciation of
      selenium (Se) were previously unknown for any species of cactus. We investigated 
      Se in Opuntia ficus-indica using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,
      microfocused x-ray fluorescence elemental and chemical mapping (muXRF), Se K-edge
      x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, and liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). muXRF showed Se concentrated inside
      small conic, vestigial leaves (cladode tips), the cladode vasculature, and the
      seed embryos. Se K-edge XANES demonstrated that approximately 96% of total Se in 
      cladode, fruit juice, fruit pulp, and seed is carbon-Se-carbon (C-Se-C). Micro
      and bulk XANES analysis showed that cladode tips contained both selenate and
      C-Se-C forms. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry quantification of Se
      in high-performance liquid chromatography fractions followed by LC-MS structural 
      identification showed selenocystathionine-to-selenomethionine (SeMet) ratios of
      75:25, 71:29, and 32:68, respectively in cladode, fruit, and seed. Enzymatic
      digestions and subsequent analysis confirmed that Se was mainly present in a
      "free" nonproteinaceous form inside cladode and fruit, while in the seed, Se was 
      incorporated into proteins associated with lipids. muXRF chemical mapping
      illuminated the specific location of Se reduction and assimilation from selenate 
      accumulated in the cladode tips into the two LC-MS-identified C-Se-C forms before
      they were transported into the cladode mesophyll. We conclude that Opuntia is a
      secondary Se-accumulating plant whose fruit and cladode contain mostly free
      selenocystathionine and SeMet, while seeds contain mainly SeMet in protein. When 
      eaten, the organic Se forms in Opuntia fruit, cladode, and seed may improve
      health, increase Se mineral nutrition, and help prevent multiple human cancers.

PG  - 1229-30
LID - 10.4161/psb.5.10.12835 [doi]
AB  - Recently, we found that fungi are involved in breaking seed dormancy of Opuntia
      streptacantha, and that the effect of fungi on seeds is species-specific.
      However, the effect of fungi on seed germination from other Opuntia spp has not
      been evaluated. Thus, we evaluated the effect of four fungal species (Penicillium
      chrysogenum, Phoma sp., Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma koningii) on the
      germination of Opuntia leucotricha, an abundant species in the Chihuahuan Desert,
      Mexico. We found that seeds inoculated with the four fungal species had higher
      germination than control seeds. Trichoderma spp. were the most effective. Our
      results strongly indicate that fungi are involved in breaking seed dormancy of O.
      leucotricha. Thus, we suggest that these fungi could promote seed germination
      from other Opuntia species.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of ethanol and aqueous extracts
      from a stem of Opuntia ficus indica on replication of three kinds of viruses: two
      enveloped viruses [herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), influenza A virus
      (IFV-A)], and one non-enveloped virus [poliovirus type 1 (PV-1)]. Only ethanol
      extract from the cactus stem showed significant antiviral activity in vitro. Two 
      chlorophyll derivatives, pheophorbide a and pyropheophorbide a, were isolated as 
      active substances exhibiting potent virucidal effects on HSV-2 and IFV-A, but no 
      activity against PV-1 was observed. These findings suggest that these active
      compounds might recognize specific glycoproteins of enveloped viruses, precluding
      their binding to host cell receptors and inhibiting viral infections.

AB  - Opuntia humifusa, a member of the Cactaceae family widely distributed in the
      southern regions of the Korean peninsula, has potential bioactive functions and
      medicinal benefits. In the present study, we investigated the effect of hexane,
      ethyl acetate extracts and water partitioned fraction of O. humifusa on
      proliferation, G1 arrest and apoptosis in U87MG human glioblastoma cells.
      Glioblastoma cellular proliferation was evaluated using the MTT
      (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, and the
      effects of O. humifusa partitioned extracts on cell cycle and apoptosis were
      analyzed by flow cytometry. Our results revealed that when U87MG cells were
      treated with hexane extracts and water partitioned fraction of O. humifusa, the
      number of viable cells decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. In
      addition, water partitioned fractions of O. humifusa induced G1 arrest and
      non-apoptotic cell death as well as significant increases in ROS production in
      U87MG cells. In conclusion, water partitioned fractions of O. humifusa induce G1 
      arrest and inhibit U87MG human glioblastoma cell proliferation.

TI  - Stabilization of the bioactive pigment of opuntia fruits through maltodextrin
      encapsulation.
PG  - 10646-52
LID - 10.1021/jf101695f [doi]
AB  - Betalains are water-soluble, nitrogen-containing pigments of growing interest in 
      the food industry. They are present in most plants belonging to the order
      Caryophyllales, where they fulfill the role of anthocyanins, and are divided into
      two groups: violet betacyanins and yellow betaxanthins. They are bioactive
      molecules that account for health-promoting properties, recently described for
      cactus pears (Opuntia). In this work, the characteristic betalain of cactus
      pears, indicaxanthin, is obtained purely, and its stability is highly promoted by
      its encapsulation in a maltodextrin matrix. A suitable spray-drying procedure for
      encapsulation is described, and a bright yellow powder is obtained. The stability
      is analyzed under different conditions. In the absence of light, pure
      encapsulated pigment can be stored at 20 degrees C for months without appreciable
      loss of the bioactive substance and color variation. Furthermore, free radical
      scavenging and antioxidant properties of the pigment are studied under the
      ABTS(*+) radical and ferric reducing antioxidant power assays, in the presence
      and in the absence of maltodextrins. The stabilization of pure betalain pigments 
      may boost the use of these bioactive and natural coloring molecules.

TI  - Thermophilic laccase from xerophyte species Opuntia vulgaris.
PG  - 707-11
LID - 10.1002/bmc.1506 [doi]
AB  - Two laccase temperature isoforms capable of oxidizing phenolic compounds to
      quinones were isolated and purified to homogeneity from the cladodes of the
      xerophyte species Opuntia vulgaris. These catalytically active proteins exhibit
      apparent molecular masses of 137 and 90 kDa. Under reducing conditions, both
      isoforms yielded a subunit molecular mass of 43 kDa, suggesting that the enzyme
      is a multimer of the 43 kDa subunit. The 137 kDa isoform when heated at 80
      degrees C for 3 min generated three polypeptide bands on activity stained
      polyacrylamide gels exhibiting 137, 90 and 43 kDa molecular forms. All isoforms
      of the enzyme exhibited an optimum pH of 10 when 2,6-dimethoxyphenol was used as 
      a substrate. The optimum temperature of the 137 kDa enzyme form was noted to be
      80 degrees C and that of the 90 kDa enzyme form was 70 degrees C. Denaturation
      kinetics of both the laccase isoforms carried out at their respective optimum
      temperatures for 30 min exhibited enzyme activity in excess of their t(1/2)
      values throughout the assay period. The K(m) for the 137 kDa form was determined 
      to be 2.2 +/- 0.3 mm and the V(max) was 2.8 +/- 0.2 IU/mL. These high temperature
      stable laccase isoforms having alkaline pH optima can find significant industrial
      use.

TI  - Determination of antioxidant constituents in cactus pear fruits.
PG  - 253-9
LID - 10.1007/s11130-010-0189-x [doi]
AB  - An analytical study was carried out on the presence of antioxidant constituents
      and the in vitro antioxidant capacity in the extracts of three species of Spanish
      red-skinned cactus pear fruits (Opuntia ficus-indica, Opuntia undulata and
      Opuntia stricta). The cactus pear fruit extracts were analyzed for determined
      constituents: ascorbic acid, flavonoids (quercetin, isorhamnetin, myricetin,
      kaempferol and luteolin), betalains, taurine, total carotenoids and total
      phenolics. The antioxidant capacity was assessed by means of two different
      methods: the 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Trolox
      equivalent antioxidant capacity) method and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
      radical method. Opuntia ficus-indica fruit extract had the strongest antioxidant 
      capacity and taurine content. O. stricta fruits were the richest in ascorbic acid
      and total phenolics, whereas O. undulata fruits showed the highest carotenoid
      content. Quercetin and isorhamnetin were the main flavonoids detected. This study
      provides basic information on the presence of bioactive compounds and antioxidant
      capacity in extracts of cactus pear fruits, in order to consider these extracts
      as ingredient for the production of health-promoting food.

TI  - Extracts of edible and medicinal plants damage membranes of Vibrio cholerae.
PG  - 6888-94
LID - 10.1128/AEM.03052-09 [doi]
AB  - The use of natural compounds from plants can provide an alternative approach
      against food-borne pathogens. The mechanisms of action of most plant extracts
      with antimicrobial activity have been poorly studied. In this work, changes in
      membrane integrity, membrane potential, internal pH (pH(in)), and ATP synthesis
      were measured in Vibrio cholerae cells after exposure to extracts of edible and
      medicinal plants. A preliminary screen of methanolic, ethanolic, and aqueous
      extracts of medicinal and edible plants was performed. Minimal bactericidal
      concentrations (MBCs) were measured for extracts showing high antimicrobial
      activity. Our results indicate that methanolic extracts of basil (Ocimum
      basilicum L.), nopal cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica var. Villanueva L.), sweet
      acacia (Acacia farnesiana L.), and white sagebrush (Artemisia ludoviciana Nutt.) 
      are the most active against V. cholera, with MBCs ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 mg/ml. 
      Using four fluorogenic techniques, we studied the membrane integrity of V.
      cholerae cells after exposure to these four extracts. Extracts from these plants 
      were able to disrupt the cell membranes of V. cholerae cells, causing increased
      membrane permeability, a clear decrease in cytoplasmic pH, cell membrane
      hyperpolarization, and a decrease in cellular ATP concentration in all strains
      tested. These four plant extracts could be studied as future alternatives to
      control V. cholerae contamination in foods and the diseases associated with this 
      microorganism.

TI  - Development and characterization of edible films based on mucilage of Opuntia
      ficus-indica (L.).
PG  - E347-52
LID - 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01661.x [doi]
AB  - Mucilage of Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) was extracted and characterized by its
      composition and molecular weight distribution. Mucilage film-forming dispersions 
      were prepared under different pHs (3, 4, 5.6, 7, and 8) and calcium concentration
      (0% and 30% of CaCl(2), with respect to mucilage's weight), and their particle
      size determined. Mucilage films with and without calcium (MFCa and MF,
      respectively) were prepared. The effect of calcium and pH on mucilage films was
      evaluated determining thickness, color, water vapor permeability (WVP), tensile
      strength (TS), and percentage of elongation (%E). The average molecular weight of
      the different fractions of mucilage was: 3.4 x 10(6) (0.73%), 1 x 10(5) (1.46%), 
      1.1 x 10(3) (45.79%), and 2.4 x 10(2) Da (52.03%). Aqueous mucilage dispersions
      with no calcium presented particles with an average size d(0.5) of 15.4 microm,
      greater than the dispersions with calcium, 13.2 microm. MFCa films showed more
      thickness (0.13 mm) than the MF films (0.10 mm). The addition of calcium
      increased the WVP of the films from 109.94 to 130.45 gmm/m(2)dkPa. Calcium and pH
      affected the mechanical properties of the films; the largest TS was observed on
      MF films, whereas the highest %E was observed on MFCa films. The highest
      differences among MF and MFCa films were observed at pHs 5.6 and 7 for TS and at 
      pHs 4 and 8 for %E. No effect of pH and calcium was observed on luminosity and
      hue angle. Chroma values were higher for MF when compared with MFCa, and
      increased as pH of the films increased. Practical Application: In this study
      mucilage from nopal was extracted and characterized by its ability to form edible
      films under different pHs, and with or without the addition of calcium. Opuntia
      ficus-indica mucilage had the ability to form edible films. In general, it can be
      considered that mucilage films without modification of pH and without the
      addition of calcium have the best water vapor barrier properties and tensile
      strength. Mucilage from nopal could represent a good option for the development
      of edible films in countries where nopal is highly produced at low cost,
      constituting a processing alternative for nopal.

TI  - Physicochemical, nutritional, and functional characterization of fruits
      xoconostle (Opuntia matudae) pears from Central-Mexico Region.
PG  - C485-92

AB  - Xoconostle cv. Cuaresmeno (Opuntia matudae) has attracted domestic and
      international industry attention; however, variations of composition from
      xoconostle structures have not been evaluated. Industries discard the pulp
      (endocarp) and peel (pericarp) as wastes and utilize the skin (mesocarp), which
      is the edible portion. The physicochemical, nutritional, and functional
      characterization of structures from xoconostle pear from 3 major sites of
      production in Mexico were assessed. Skin yield ranged from 58% to 64% and was
      higher to that of peel (22% to 24%) and pulp (12% to 18%) yields. pH, degrees
      Brix, and acidity were similar among xoconostle structures. Total fiber showed by
      peel (18.23% to 20.37%) was 2-fold higher than that of skin. Protein and ether
      extract were higher in xoconostle pulp compared to that showed by peel and skin. 
      Iron content of xoconostle peel (6 to 9.6 mg/100 g, DWB) was higher to that of
      skin and pulp and prickly pear pulp. Soluble phenols of peel (840 to 863 mg
      GAE/100 g, DWB) were almost similar to that of skin (919 to 986 mg GAE/100 g, dry
      weigh basis); meanwhile, ascorbic acid concentration of skin was 2-fold higher
      compared to that of peel. The phenolic fraction of xoconostle structures
      consisted of gallic, vanillic, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acids; catechin, epicatechin,
      and vanillin were also identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-didoe
      array detection (HPLC-DAD). Xoconostle peel showed higher antioxidant activity
      (TEAC) compared to that of skin (2-fold) and pulp (6-fold) of commonly consumed
      fruits and vegetables. The potential of xoconostle peel and pulp for the
      production of feed or food is promissory. Practical Application: Outstanding
      nutritional and functional properties of xoconostle cv. Cuaresmeno fruits are
      demonstrated. Increased consumption could contribute positively to improve the
      diet of rural and urban consumers. The high fiber, mineral, and antioxidant
      components of xoconostle peel and pulp suggest that these fruit structures, which
      are currently discarded as waste, have promissory use as feed or food by
      industry.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of two different Opuntia ficus-indica extracts for blood
      sugar lowering effects in rats.
PG  - 370-5
LID - 10.1002/ptr.3271 [doi]
AB  - Stems of Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill. (OFI) are traditionally used in Mexico
      to treat diabetes mellitus. Less research data are available for combinations of 
      stem and fruit preparations. The present study was designed to investigate the
      effects of an aqueous extract prepared from the cladodes and a proprietary
      stem/fruit skin-blend (stem/fruit skin ratio 75/25) of OFI on blood glucose and
      plasma insulin in normal rats. A dose finding study with the traditional cladode 
      OFI extract revealed that maximum effects on blood glucose and insulin were
      observed after oral administration in a dose range of 6-176 mg/kg. The
      proprietary OFI blend significantly lowered blood glucose levels in the glucose
      tolerance test to a similar extent (p < 0.05 vs control) as the traditional
      aqueous cladode extract when administered in a dose of 6 mg/kg. In contrast to
      the aqueous extract, the proprietary blend significantly increased basal plasma
      insulin levels (p < 0.01 vs control) indicating a direct action on pancreatic
      beta cells. The results suggest that both OFI extracts exert hypoglycemic
      activities in rats in doses as low as 6 mg/kg but that the effects of the
      proprietary stem/fruit blend were more pronounced in our model.

PG  - 1120-6
LID - 10.1016/j.phymed.2010.05.001 [doi]
AB  - Opuntia ficus indica f. inermis methanolic root extract (ORE) was investigated
      for phenolic and flavonoids contents, in vitro evaluated for DPPH radical
      scavenging activity, reducing power and in vivo tested for its gastro-protective 
      ability against 80% ethanol induced ulcer in rats. Phytochemical test of ORE were
      positive for phenolic and flavonoid contents. DPPH radical scavenging activity
      and reducing power of ORE showed an EC(50) of 118.65+/-2.51 mug/ml and 300 mug/ml
      respectively. In vivo the pre-treatment of rats with ranitidine (50 mg/kg) and
      200, 400, and 800 mg/kg doses of ORE significantly (p<0.05) reduced the 80%
      ethanol induced-ulcer lesion, with a rate of 82.68%, 49.21%, 83.13%, and 92.59%
      respectively, and prevented the depletion of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide
      dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total glutathione 
      (GSH), and inhibited the increase of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malondialdehyde
      (MDA) in rat stomach tissues when compared with ethanol group. Also pre-treatment
      with ORE marked a dose-dependent attenuation of histopathology changes induced by
      ethanol. Phenolic and flavonoids wealth, radical scavenging activity, and
      reducing power, have been implicated for antiulcer property of ORE.

PG  - 210-6
LID - 10.1007/s11130-010-0176-2 [doi]
AB  - Dietary fiber and bioactive compounds are widely used as functional ingredients
      in processed foods. The market in this field is competitive and the development
      of new types of quality ingredients for the food industry is on the rise. Opuntia
      ficus-indica (cactus pear) produces edible tender stems (cladodes) and fruits
      with a high nutritional value in terms of minerals, protein, dietary fiber and
      phytochemicals; however, around 20% of fresh weight of cladodes and 45% of fresh 
      weight of fruits are by-products. The objective of this study was therefore to
      determine the nutritional value of by-products obtained from cladodes and fruits 
      from two varieties of Opuntia ficus-indica, examining their dietary fiber and
      natural antioxidant compound contents in order to obtain quality ingredients for 
      functional foods and increase the added value of these by-products.

LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2010.05.047 [doi]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute and chronic
      effects of OpunDia (Opuntia ficus-indica) in obese pre-diabetic men and women.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This double-blind placebo controlled study included
      participants (age range of 20-50 years) randomly assigned to one of the two
      groups and given a 16-week supply of either the 200 mg OpunDia (n=15), or placebo
      (n=14). The acute phase of the study consisted of an oral glucose tolerance test 
      (OGTT) with a 400 mg bolus of OpunDia given 30 min before orally ingesting a 75 g
      glucose drink. Baseline and post 16-week concentrations of glucose, insulin,
      hsCRP, adiponectin, proinsulin, Hb1Ac, cholesterol, and a comprehensive metabolic
      panel were collected along with body composition measured via densitometry (BOD
      POD). A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to determine any significant
      interactions between group and time. Follow-up analysis was performed to
      determine differences among groups at each time point. Paired t-tests were
      performed on all variables to determine if any within group differences existed
      across time. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease (P<0.05) in 
      the blood glucose concentrations at the 60 (205.92+/-36.90 and 188.84+/-38.43
      mg/dL, respectively), 90 (184.55+/-33.67 and 169.74+/-35.16 mg/dL, respectively) 
      and 120 min (159.24+/-17.85 and 148.89+/-24.86 mg/dL, respectively) time points
      with the pre-OGTT compared to the OpunDia bolus trial. There were no
      between-group differences found with the OGTT time points, area under the curve, 
      blood chemistry variables (insulin, hsCRP, adiponectin, proinsulin, Hb1Ac), diet 
      analysis variables (carbohydrates, fat, protein and total kcals), body
      composition variables (fat mass, fat free mass, percent body fat and total body
      weight), or blood chemistry safety parameters (comprehensive metabolic panel)
      pre-to-post 16-week intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the acute blood
      glucose lowering effects and the long-term safety of the proprietary product
      OpunDia, thus supporting the traditional use of Opuntia ficus-indica for blood
      glucose management.

PG  - 7565-71
LID - 10.1021/jf100434e [doi]
AB  - We investigated, using an organ bath technique, the effects of a hydrophilic
      extract from Opuntia ficus indica fruit pulp (cactus fruit extract, CFE) on the
      motility of mouse ileum, and researched the extract component(s) responsible for 
      the observed responses. CFE (10-320 mg of fresh fruit pulp equivalents/mL of
      organ bath) reduced dose-dependently the spontaneous contractions. This effect
      was unaffected by tetrodotoxin, a neuronal blocker, N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine
      methyl ester, a nitric oxide synthase blocker, tetraethylammonium, a potassium
      channel blocker, or atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. CFE also reduced 
      the contractions evoked by carbachol, without affecting the contractions evoked
      by high extracellular potassium. Indicaxanthin, but not ascorbic acid, assayed at
      concentrations comparable with their content in CFE, mimicked the CFE effects.
      The data show that CFE is able to exert direct antispasmodic effects on the
      intestinal motility. The CFE inhibitory effects do not involve potassium channels
      or voltage-dependent calcium channels but rather pathways of calcium
      intracellular release. The fruit pigment indicaxanthin appears to be the main
      component responsible for the CFE-induced effects.

TI  - Probable hypoglycemic adverse drug reaction associated with prickly pear cactus, 
      glipizide, and metformin in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1334-7
LID - 10.1345/aph.1P148 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) in a patient with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus taking prickly pear cactus (PPC), glipizide, and
      metformin. CASE SUMMARY: A 58-year-old Mexican male with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      being treated with metformin 1000 mg twice daily and extended-release glipizide
      10 mg daily was referred to the pharmacist for medication education. He denied
      taking herbal supplements or experiencing hypoglycemia. Two hemoglobin A(1c)
      values (6.8% and 6.7%) obtained over the past year demonstrated glycemic control,
      which was supported by his reported fasting blood glucose readings of 113-132
      mg/dL. One month later, the patient reported 4 hypoglycemic events with blood
      glucose readings of 49-68 mg/dL, which resulted in discontinuation of glipizide. 
      One month later, the patient denied any further hypoglycemia. During medication
      reconciliation he reported consuming crude PPC pads daily for 2 months for
      glucose control. DISCUSSION: Literature suggests that PPC has an effect on
      lowering blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, although
      few identified data describe ADRs from combining PPC with other agents used in
      treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. A literature search of MEDLINE (through
      December 2009) using the search terms diabetes mellitus, prickly pear cactus,
      nopal, opuntia, metformin, glipizide, glyburide, glimepiride, and sulfonylurea
      revealed no case reports of the described ADR. One case report describing the
      blood glucose-lowering effect of PPC in a patient concurrently taking oral
      antihyperglycemics documented an episode of hypoglycemia, although the Naranjo
      probability scale was not applied. One patient survey discovered the most common 
      drug-herbal interaction in the given population to be between PPC and
      antihyperglycemic agents, resulting in hypoglycemia. In our case, use of the
      Naranjo probability scale suggests the ADR to be probable. The mechanism may be
      due to the additive glucose lowering of the 3 agents consumed concurrently by the
      patient. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus should be routinely 
      counseled about the use of herbal products to minimize the risk of ADRs.

      cells.
PG  - 78-85

AB  - The present study was performed to investigate the anti-allergy potentials of
      glycoprotein (90kDa) isolated from Opuntia ficus-indica var. saboten MAKINO (OFI 
      glycoprotein) in vivo (ICR mice) and in vitro (RBL-2H3 cells). At first, to know 
      whether the OFI glycoprotein has an inhibitory ability for allergy in vivo, we
      evaluated the activities of allergy-related factors such as histamine and
      beta-hexosaminidase release, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin 4
      (IL-4) in compound 48/80 (8 ml/kg BW)-treated ICR mice. After that, we studied to
      found the effect for anti-allergy in vitro such as nuclear factor kappa B
      (NF-kappaB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, arachidonic acid, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
      in compound 48/80 (5 microg/ml)-treated RBL-2H3 cells. Our results showed that
      the OFI glycoprotein (5 mg/kg) inhibited histamine and beta-hexosaminidase
      release, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin 4 (IL-4) in mice serum.
      Also OFI glycoprotein (25 microg/ml) has suppressive effects on the expression of
      MAPK (ERK1/2), and on protein expression of anti-allergic proteins (iNOS and
      COX-2). Thus, we speculate that the OFI glycoprotein is an example of natural
      compound that blocks anti-allergic signal transduction pathways.

TI  - Antidepressant-like Effect of Kaempferol and Quercitirin, Isolated from Opuntia
      ficus-indica var. saboten.
PG  - 30-8
LID - 10.5607/en.2010.19.1.30 [doi]
AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica var. saboten. is widely cultivated in Jeju Island (South
      Korea) for use in manufacture of health foods. This study described
      antidepressant effect of two flavonoids (kaempferol and quercitrin) isolated from
      the Opuntia ficus-indica var. saboten. The expression of the hypothalamic POMC
      mRNA or plasma beta-endorphin levels were increased by extract of Opuntia
      ficus-indica var. saboten or its flavoniods administered orally. In addition,
      antidepressant activity was studied using tail suspension test (TST), forced
      swimming test (FST) and rota-rod test in chronically restraint immobilization
      stress group in mice. After restraint stress (2 hrs/day for 14 days), animals
      were kept in cage for 14 days without any further stress, bet with drugs. Mice
      were fed with a diet supplemented for 14 days and during the behavioral test
      period with kaempferol or quercitrin (30 mg/kg/day). POMC mRNA or plasma
      beta-endorphin level was increased by extract of Opuntia ficus-indica var.
      saboten and its flavoniods. In addition, immobility time in TST and FST was
      significantly reduced by kaempferol or quercitrin. In rota-rod test, the time of 
      permanence was maintained to the semblance of control group in turning at 15 rpm.
      Our results suggest that two flavonoids (kaempferol and quercitrin) isolated from
      the Opuntia ficus-indica var. saboten. show a potent antidepressant effect.

TI  - The n-butanolic extract of Opuntia ficus-indica var. saboten enhances long-term
      memory in the passive avoidance task in mice.
PG  - 1011-7
LID - 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.05.015 [doi]
AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica var. saboten Makino (Cactaceae) is used to treat burns,
      edema, dyspepsia, and asthma in traditional medicine. The present study
      investigated the beneficial effects of the n-butanolic extract of O. ficus-indica
      var. saboten (BOF) on memory performance in mice and attempts to uncover the
      mechanisms underlying its action. Memory performance was assessed with the
      passive avoidance task, and western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used
      to measure changes in protein expression and cell survival. After the oral
      administration of BOF for 7 days, the latency time in the passive avoidance task 
      was significantly increased relative to vehicle-treated controls (P<0.05).
      Western blotting revealed that the expression levels of brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated cAMP response element binding-protein 
      (pCREB), and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) 1/2 were
      significantly increased in hippocampal tissue after 7 days of BOF administration 
      (P<0.05). Doublecortin and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine immunostaining also revealed
      that BOF significantly enhanced the survival of immature neurons, but did not
      affect neuronal cell proliferation in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal
      dentate gyrus. These results suggest that the subchronic administration of BOF
      enhances long-term memory, and that this effect is partially mediated by
      ERK-CREB-BDNF signaling and the survival of immature neurons.

AB  - Little is known about the performance of South African cactus pear varieties in
      different agro-ecological regions. Effects of locality on internal quality
      parameters of available cactus pear varieties were examined. With only one
      exception, no significant differences among the mean replication values for the
      different parameters between the different locations were observed. The
      differences between mean values for most individual parameters at the three
      localities were highly significant. Highly significant differences between the
      mean values for the measured characteristics were observed, not only among the
      locations (except for the pulp glucose values), but also for the influences of
      genotype and interaction between locality and genotype. Significant variations
      existed between mean values of the different characteristics between localities. 
      Genotype x environmental interactions were noted. It was concluded that Meyers is
      the most appropriate cultivar for economical purposes in South Africa.

TI  - Determination of the folate content in cladodes of nopal (Opuntia ficus indica)
      by microbiological assay utilizing Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 7469) and
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
PG  - 6472-5

AB  - Prickly pear cactus has been an important food source in Mexico since ancient
      times due to its economical and ecological benefits and potential nutraceutical
      value. Nevertheless, studies on the nutritional aspects and health benefits have 
      been scarce. The purpose of this study was to assess, apparently for the first
      time, the folate contents of cladodes of nopal by a microbiological assay, using 
      Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 7469) in extracts that were enzymatically treated to
      release the bound vitamin, employing single, dual, and trienzymatic procedures,
      and using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We used Opuntia cladodes
      of different length sizes. The microbiological assay showed some differences
      among enzyme treatments and sizes of nopal; the trienzyme treatment
      (alpha-amylase-protease-conjugase) was more efficient in determining the folate
      content in nopal, giving 5.0 ng/g in the small size cladodes at 54 h of testing
      time, while ELISA showed no significant differences in the folate content among
      sizes of cladodes (5.5-5.62 ng/g at 0 min testing time). Both techniques may be
      used for the assessment of folate content in cladodes, but ELISA is more rapid
      and reliable.

TI  - Removal of sediment and bacteria from water using green chemistry.
PG  - 3514-9
LID - 10.1021/es9030744 [doi]
AB  - Although nearly all newly derived water purification methods have improved the
      water quality in developing countries, few have been accepted and maintained for 
      long-term use. Field studies indicate that the most beneficial methods use
      indigenous resources, as they are both accessible and accepted by communities
      they help. In an effort to implement a material that will meet community needs,
      two fractions of mucilage gum were extracted from the Opuntia ficus-indica cactus
      and tested as flocculation agents against sediment and bacterial contamination.
      As diatomic ions are known to affect both mucilage and promote cell aggregation, 
      CaCl(2) was studied in conjunction and compared with mucilage as a bacteria
      removal method. To evaluate performance, ion-rich waters that mimic natural water
      bodies were prepared. Column tests containing suspensions of the sediment kaolin 
      exhibited particle flocculation and settling rates up to 13.2 cm/min with
      mucilage versus control settling rates of 0.5 cm/min. Bacillus cereus tests
      displayed flocculation and improved settling times with mucilage concentrations
      lower than 5 ppm and removal rates between 97 and 98% were observed for high
      bacteria concentration tests (>10(8) cells/ml). This natural material not only
      displays water purification abilities, but it is also affordable, renewable and
      readily available.

TI  - A preliminary study on the in vitro antioxidant activity of the stems of opuntia 
      vulgaris.
PG  - 268-72
AB  - The in vitro antioxidant activity of stems of Opuntia vulgaris Mill had been
      investigated by estimating degree of non-enzymatic haemoglobin glycosylation
      measured colorimetrically at 520 urn. It was found that benzene and chloroform
      extract of O. vulgaris had better antioxidant activity than petroleum ether,
      ethyl acetate, ethanol and aqueous extract. The antioxidant activity of the
      extracts was concentration dependent and comparable to that of D-alpha-
      tocopherol (vitamin E) and ascorbic acid (vitamin C), standard antioxidant
      compounds used.

LID - 10.3390/ijms11010254 [doi]
AB  - Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were assembled by using the bougainvillea
      flowers, red turnip and the purple wild Sicilian prickly pear fruit juice
      extracts as natural sensitizers of TiO(2) films. The yellow orange indicaxanthin 
      and the red purple betacyanins are the main components in the cocktail of natural
      dyes obtained from these natural products. The best overall solar energy
      conversion efficiency of 1.7% was obtained, under AM 1.5 irradiation, with the
      red turnip extract, that showed a remarkable current density (Jsc = 9.5 mA/cm(2))
      and a high IPCE value (65% at lambda = 470 nm). Also the purple extract of the
      wild Sicilian prickly pear fruit showed interesting performances, with a Jsc of
      9.4 mA/cm(2), corresponding to a solar to electrical power conversion of 1.26%.

TI  - Characterization of calcium oxalate biominerals in Pereskia species (Cactaceae).
PG  - 763-6
AB  - Calcium oxalate druses were isolated from the stems and leaves of six
      Pereskioideae family members and investigated by infrared spectroscopy, showing
      that in all samples the biomineral was present in the form of whewellite, CaC2O4 
      x H2O. As Pereskia is thought to represent the "ancestral" condition of the
      leafless stem-succulent cacti, these results suggest that the biomineralization
      of calcium oxalate in Cactaceae represents a primitive characteristic of the
      group and also support a close genetic relationship between Pereskia and Opuntia.

PG  - 10323-30
LID - 10.1021/jf9022096 [doi]
AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes represent the green stem of the plant and are
      generally used as animal feed or disposed of in landfills. The present work
      investigated the anatomical and chemical composition of Opuntia cladodes, which
      form the basis of their pharmacological effects. Glucose and galacturonic acid
      were the main sugars of Opuntia cladodes, whereas high-performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed the presence of mainly kaempherol and
      isorhamnetin glycosides (glucoside and rhamnoside). The presence of high amounts 
      of calcium oxalate crystals was demonstrated by light microscopy on fresh and
      lyophilized cladodes. No antimicrobial activity was observed even after enzymatic
      treatment. O. ficus-indica cladodes may retain material tightly associated with
      cell-wall components, and this property will have the potential to greatly reduce
      the bioavailability of bioactive compounds.

PG  - 587-94
LID - 10.1002/ptr.2996 [doi]
AB  - Dehydrated extract of the prickly pear fruit Opuntia ficus indica, Cacti-Nea, was
      evaluated for its chronic diuretic and antioxidant effects in Wistar rats.
      Cacti-Nea was orally administered daily for seven days at the dose of 240
      mg/kg/day. A positive group was orally treated with hydrochlorothiazide at the
      dose of 10 mg/kg/day and a control group with vehicle. Daily measurements of body
      weight, urine volume, and concentration of sodium, potassium and uric acid in
      urine were performed for each rat. At the end of the study, the blood globular
      level of glutathione peroxidase was determined. Cacti-Nea significantly increased
      the urine volumes excreted by rats in comparison with the control group and it
      showed a trend to reduce significantly the body weight gain of rats. No
      significant differences were observed in the urine concentration of sodium,
      potassium and uric acid in comparison with the control group. The chronic
      diuretic effects of Cacti-Nea were comparable with that of the standard drug
      hydrochlorothiazide. Chronic oral administration of Cacti-Nea significantly
      increased the blood globular levels of glutathione peroxidase in comparison with 
      control and hydrochlorothiazide groups. The prickly pear fruit extract Cacti-Nea 
      demonstrated chronic diuretic and antioxidant effects in Wistar rats with respect
      to the excretion of the metabolites.

AB  - The production of extracellular and mycelia-associated penicillin G acylase
      (maPGA) with Mucor griseocyanus H/55.1.1 by surface-adhesion fermentation using
      Opuntia imbricata, a cactus, as a natural immobilization support was studied.
      Enzyme activity to form 6-aminopencillanic acid (6-APA) from penicillin G was
      assayed spectrophotometrically. The penicillin G hydrolysis to 6-APA was
      evaluated at six different times using PGA samples recovered from the skim milk
      medium at five different incubation times. Additionally, the effect of varying
      the penicillin G substrate concentration level on the PGA enzyme activity was
      also studied. The maximum reaction rate, V (max), and the Michaelis constant, K
      (M), were determined using the Michaelis-Menten model. The maximum levels for
      maPGA and extracellular activity were found to be 2,126.50 international unit per
      liter (IU/l; equal to 997.83 IU/g of support) at 48 h and 755.33 IU/l at 60 h,
      respectively. Kinetics of biomass production for total biomass showed a maximum
      growth at 60 h of 3.36 and 2.55 g/l (equal to 0.012 g of biomass per gram of
      support) for the immobilized M. griseocyanus biomass. The maPGA was employed for 
      the hydrolysis of penicillin G to obtain 6-APA in a batch reactor. The highest
      quantity of 6-APA obtained was 226.16 mg/l after 40-min reaction. The effect of
      substrate concentration on maPGA activity was evaluated at different
      concentrations of penicillin G (0-10 mM). K(M) and V(max) were determined to be
      3.0 x 10(-3) M and 4.4 x 10(-3) mM/min, respectively.

AB  - A trypsin inhibitor from Opuntia streptacantha Lemaire (Prickly pear) seeds was
      purified and characterized. Of several proteases tested, this inhibitor showed
      specificity to trypsin-like enzymes. The major inhibitor present in these seeds
      showed distinctive characteristics, most notably a low molecular weight of 4.19
      kDa, as determined by MALDI TOF, and an unusually high thermal stability,
      retaining most of the activity after heating the sample 1h to 120 degrees C with 
      a pressure of 1 kg/cm(2). Its complete amino acid sequence was obtained through
      mass spectrometry, this establishing presence a blocked N-terminal region. When
      comparing its sequence in the MEROPS database for peptidases and peptidase
      inhibitors, it showed 34.48% identity with a serine-proteinase inhibitor from the
      I15 family.

TI  - Invasive plant integration into native plant-pollinator networks across Europe.
PG  - 3887-93
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2009.1076 [doi]
AB  - The structure of plant-pollinator networks has been claimed to be resilient to
      changes in species composition due to the weak degree of dependence among
      mutualistic partners. However, detailed empirical investigations of the
      consequences of introducing an alien plant species into mutualistic networks are 
      lacking. We present the first cross-European analysis by using a standardized
      protocol to assess the degree to which a particular alien plant species (i.e.
      Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis, Impatiens glandulifera, Opuntia stricta,
      Rhododendron ponticum and Solanum elaeagnifolium) becomes integrated into
      existing native plant-pollinator networks, and how this translates to changes in 
      network structure. Alien species were visited by almost half of the pollinator
      species present, accounting on average for 42 per cent of the visits and 24 per
      cent of the network interactions. Furthermore, in general, pollinators depended
      upon alien plants more than on native plants. However, despite the fact that
      invaded communities received more visits than uninvaded communities, the dominant
      role of alien species over natives did not translate into overall changes in
      network connectance, plant linkage level and nestedness. Our results imply that
      although supergeneralist alien plants can play a central role in the networks,
      the structure of the networks appears to be very permeable and robust to the
      introduction of invasive alien species into the network.

TI  - [Floristic and physiognomic characteristics of disturbed thorny xerophytic
      scrubland in Punta de Piedras, Miranda Municipality, Zulia State, Venezuela].
PG  - 271-81
AB  - We determined the floristic and physiognomic aspects of disturbed thorny
      xerophytic scrubland in Punta de Piedras, Miranda Municipality, Zulia State,
      Venezuela. Botanical sampling was done twice monthly (November 2005-June 2006),
      in both rainy and dry seasons, for a total of 16 samples. The sampling was done
      in 10 vegetation patches, in an average area of 718,2 +/- 706,24 m2, and adjacent
      graminoid floristic components were identified using three 400 m2 (20 x 20 m)
      plots, divided into 4 subplots (20 x 5 m2) and in these, were delimited 12
      subplots (1 x 1 m2). In addition, human paths were carried out in order to
      identify other species plant. Thorny xerophytic scrubland showed human
      disturbances e.g. periodic fires, solid wastes, roads and human settlements and
      coastal semiarid thorny scrubland characteristics, similar to another Venezuelan 
      localities. Forty-five species, in 22 families were identified, and the Poaceae
      (6), Mimosaceae (4), Boraginaceae (3), Cactaceae (3), Caesalpinaceae (3),
      Euphorbiaceae (3) and Fabaceae (3) presented the highest number of species. Human
      disturbances probably favor the appearance of vegetation patches and secondary
      grassland formations. In the last, Aristida venesuelae, Aristida pittieri y
      Portulaca pilosa showed the highest relative abundances and frequencies values
      with a summatory of 49,38% and 46,86%, respectively, while in the patches there
      were observed two layer: an herbaceous layer (less than 1 m high) as well as a
      bush-tree layer (2.63 +/- 1.37 m high), comprised mostly of Opuntia wentiana,
      Piptadenia flava and Jatropha gossypifolia with relative abundances of 32,82,
      15,60 and 15,14%, respectively. The thorny xerophytic scrubland in Punta de
      Piedras presents a low number of species; however, the physiognomic
      characteristics are similar to other undisturbed thorny xerophytic scrublands in 
      Venezuela.

TI  - Impact of alien plant invaders on pollination networks in two archipelagos.
PG  - e6275
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0006275 [doi]
AB  - Mutualistic interactions between plants and animals promote integration of
      invasive species into native communities. In turn, the integrated invaders may
      alter existing patterns of mutualistic interactions. Here we simultaneously map
      in detail effects of invaders on parameters describing the topology of both
      plant-pollinator (bi-modal) and plant-plant (uni-modal) networks. We focus on the
      invader Opuntia spp., a cosmopolitan alien cactus. We compare two island systems:
      Tenerife (Canary Islands) and Menorca (Balearic Islands). Opuntia was found to
      modify the number of links between plants and pollinators, and was integrated
      into the new communities via the most generalist pollinators, but did not affect 
      the general network pattern. The plant uni-modal networks showed disassortative
      linkage, i.e. species with many links tended to connect to species with few
      links. Thus, by linking to generalist natives, Opuntia remained peripheral to
      network topology, and this is probably why native network properties were not
      affected at least in one of the islands. We conclude that the network analytical 
      approach is indeed a valuable tool to evaluate the effect of invaders on native
      communities.

LID - 10.1007/s10571-009-9417-z [doi]
AB  - Cactus polysaccharides (CP), some of the active components in Opuntia dillenii
      Haw have been reported to display neuroprotective effects in rat brain slices. In
      the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective properties of CP and their
      potential mechanisms on brain ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats, and on
      oxidative stress-induced damage in PC12 cells. Male Sprague-Dawley rats with
      ischemia following middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion were
      investigated. CP (200 mg/kg) significantly decreased the neurological deficit
      score, reduced infarct volume, decreased neuronal loss in cerebral cortex, and
      remarkably reduced the protein synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase which
      were induced by ischemia and reperfusion. Otherwise, the protective effect of CP 
      was confirmed in in vitro study. CP protected PC12 cells against hydrogen
      peroxide (H(2)O(2)) insult. Pretreatment with CP prior to H(2)O(2) exposure
      significantly elevated cell viability, reduced H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis, and
      decreased both intracellular and total accumulation of reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) production. Furthermore, CP also reversed the upregulation of Bax/Bcl-2
      mRNA ratio, the downstream cascade following ROS. These results suggest that CP
      may be a candidate compound for the treatment of ischemia and oxidative
      stress-induced neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Opuntia robusta has hermaphroditic, dioecious, and trioecious populations. To
      enhance our understanding of this breeding system diversity, we compared the
      reproductive output of males, females, and hermaphrodites in a trioecious
      population using field evaluations, controlled crosses, and progeny tests.
      Unisexuals were fully sterile in one sex function. Hermaphrodites were fully
      fertile for both functions. Consistent with the sex-allocation theory,
      unisexuality increased the quality and quantity (in males) of the gametes of the 
      functional sex, relative to those of hermaphrodites, probably explained by
      maternal and paternal effects. The increase was higher in males than in females, 
      suggesting a more expensive female function. Theoretically, this disproportional 
      increase is required for unisexuals to invade a hermaphroditic population with
      prior selfing, negligible pollen discounting, and undetectable inbreeding
      depression, features found in O. robusta, therefore helping to explain dioecious 
      populations. However, in the study population, the actual seed output of females 
      was lower and had a higher variance than that of hermaphrodites, which also
      reproduce through pollen. Unisexuals are unlikely to be maintained by their
      actual reproductive output in this pollen-limited environment. Hermaphrodites may
      persist in this population by producing their seeds autonomously and by reducing 
      interspecific fertilization by prior selfing and ovule discounting.

AB  - The interest in nopal has encouraged the use of dehydration; there are few
      studies about the effect of process parameters on the nopal polyphenol content
      and antioxidant activity. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the
      effect of air-drying flow rates on the amount and antioxidant capacity of
      extracts of Opuntia ficus indica cladodes. Nopal was dried at 45 degrees C and
      air flow rates of 3 and 5 m/sec. Samples were analyzed for moisture, total
      polyphenol, flavonoid, and flavonol contents, chain-breaking activity, inhibition
      of low-density lipoprotein and deoxyribose oxidation. Nopal drying at an air flow
      rate of 3 m/sec showed higher values of phenols, flavonoids and flavonols. The
      best value of low-density lipoprotein inhibition and deoxyribose was found at
      1,000 microg/ml. The air flow rate affected the amount of polyphenols and the OH(
      . ) radical scavenging, but did not modify the chain-breaking activity and the
      low-density lipoprotein inhibition activity.

AB  - Juices of nine prickly pears (Opuntia spp.) were characterized in terms of color,
      acidity, sugar content, phenolics, flavonoids, betalains and antioxidant activity
      and tested in vitro against four cancer cell lines. The juices had pH s,
      acidities and sugar ranging from 4.27 to 5.46, 0.03 to 0.27% and 8 to 14.7
      degrees Brix, respectively. Juices also varied in color from white to purple and 
      contained total phenolics, flavonoids, betaxanthins, betacyanins and antioxidant 
      capacity ranging from 22 to 226 microg gallic acid eq/g, 95 to 374 microg
      quercetin eq/g, 3 to 189 microg/g, 1.6 to 300 microg/g and 17 to 25 micromoles
      Trolox eq./mL, respectively. Among the cancer lines tested, viability of prostate
      and colon cells were the most affected. Moradillo contained the highest
      flavonoids and diminished both prostate and colon cancer cell viability without
      affecting mammary or hepatic cancer cells. Rastrero reduced the growth of the
      four cancer cell lines without affecting normal fibroblast viability. The
      research shows intervarietal differences among prickly pears in terms of juice
      properties and phytochemicals that could prevent oxidative stress and cancer.

      Opuntia cacti flowers.
PG  - 1346-53

AB  - Developmental instability (DI) as measured by fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been
      proposed to reflect fitness and stress. Furthermore, the associated developmental
      buffering may reduce morphological variation, conceal the expression of genetic
      variation and as such play an important role in evolutionary biology. However,
      observed associations between FA and various forms of stress and quality appear
      very heterogeneous. Presently it is difficult to interpret the biological
      relevance of this heterogeneity because little is known about the link between FA
      and the underlying process of DI, casting doubt whether DI can be viewed as an
      individual property and how closely FA reflects the underlying process of DI.
      Therefore, studies that explicitly test the validity of assumptions of the
      proposed theoretical models and estimate between-individual variations in DI are 
      needed. We present data on Opuntia cacti floral traits confirming that the normal
      distribution can be viewed as an appropriate approximation of the distribution of
      DI and that the concept of hypothetical repeatability can provide useful insights
      into the interpretation of patterns in FA as a measure of DI. Furthermore, we
      detected significant between-individual variation in DI. Measuring petals from
      several flowers within individual plants allowed making inference of individual
      DI.

TI  - [Gastropods associated with the calcareous alga Halimeda opuntia (Udoteaceae) in 
      Puerto Rico].
PG  - 1665-75
AB  - Gastropod communities associated with the calcareous green alga Halimeda opuntia 
      are described and compared for two Puerto Rico coral reefs: one in the northeast 
      with front tradewinds (windward zone) and one in the southwest (leeward zone). We
      analyzed the content of 21 lots (2432 g) of H. opuntia from leeward zone and 15
      lots (2448 g) from the windward zone. In total we recovered 526 gastropods
      (prosobranchs) classified in 54 taxa. Thirteen species of gastropods represented 
      79.6% of the community. Differences between species richness and mean density
      values were not significant (p > 0.100). Forty species were identified from
      leeward and thirty one (31) species from windward. Gastropod mean density was
      13.9/100 g of algae in leeward and 7.6/100 g in windward. Significant differences
      were found for the Simpson Diversity Index (0.91 in the leeward and 0.82 in the
      windward community; t = 3.44, alpha = 0.005). We found no correlation between the
      weight of the algae and the frequency of the gastropods (R2 = 0.0893 in leeward, 
      0.0249 windward and 0.0923 for both). The relationship between species
      composition in lots of windward and leeward study sites was explored via polar
      ordination and no segregation was found. When compared, the gastropod communities
      found in H. opuntia collected in coral reefs in Puerto Rico were more similar
      within them than any other communities found in other genera of seaweed and in
      other environments. Our results agree with the hypothesis that H. opuntia offers 
      the interstitial community a protected microhabitat from water movement impact.
      H. opuntia creates more homogenous conditions than those of the habitat where we 
      found the algae.

TI  - Taxonomy and phylogeny of the Fusarium dimerum species group.
PG  - 44-70
AB  - The morphospecies Fusarium dimerum, known only from its anamorph, comprises at
      least 12 phylogenetically distinct species. Analyses of the large subunit
      ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) show they are taxa of the Nectriaceae (Hypocreales),
      related to F. domesticum and form a phylogenetically distinct clade within
      Fusarium. Fusarium dimerum, for which no herbarium material could be located, is 
      characterized by macroconidia with a single, median septum, according to the
      original description and illustration. Fusarium lunatum (= F. dimerum var.
      violaceum) forms similar but longer macroconidia and purple, catenate or
      clustered chlamydospores. Fusarium delphinoides sp. nov., F. biseptatum sp. nov.,
      F. penzigii sp. nov., F. nectrioides comb. nov. (= F. dimerum var. nectrioides)
      and two unnamed Fusarium spp. produce macroconidia with mostly two or rarely
      three septa. The name F. dimerum, which originally was applied to a fungus from a
      citron, is used for a taxon including isolates causing infections in
      immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Fusarium nectrioides, F.
      delphinoides, F. penzigii and F. biseptatum are known from soil and dead plant
      substrata or rarely as agents of trauma-related eye infections of humans.
      Fusarium lunatum is an inhabitant of the cladodes of species within the cactus
      genera Opuntia and Gymnocalycium. Its unnamed closest sister taxon, which also
      forms 1-septate macroconidia and purple, clustered chlamydospores, was isolated
      from a human sinus. Fusarium delphinoides is a pathogen of the cactus-like
      African species Hoodia gordonii (Apocynaceae). Phylogenetic analyses based on
      combined sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region, LSU rDNA and
      partial sequences of the elongation factor 1-alpha and beta-tubulin genes
      identified a clade of several species producing predominately 2-septate
      macroconidia as the reciprocally monophyletic sister of F. dimerum. The basal
      sister group of the two aforementioned clades includes Fusarium lunatum and two
      undescribed species, all of which form 1-septate macroconidia.

TI  - Seawater temperature alters feeding discrimination by cold-temperate but not
      subtropical individuals of an ectothermic herbivore.
PG  - 75-84
AB  - Seawater temperature varies across multiple spatial and temporal scales, yet the 
      roles that such variation play in altering biotic interactions are poorly known. 
      We assessed temperature-mediated feeding behavior exhibited by the herbivorous
      amphipod Ampithoe longimana collected from cold-temperate and subtropical
      estuaries (27 degrees N and 41 degrees N, respectively). Individuals were offered
      a pairwise feeding choice between lyophilized seaweeds that provide higher
      fitness (Ulva intestinalis) or lower fitness (Halimeda tuna, H. opuntia, Amphiroa
      spp., or Stypopodium zonale). Overall, herbivores preferentially consumed the
      higher quality U. intestinalis more than any lower quality food. However, the
      strength of this feeding choice was not consistent. Northern herbivores consumed 
      proportionally more poorer quality tissue at 25 degrees C than at 20 degrees C in
      two assays (H. opuntia and Amphiroa sp.), consumed less poorer quality tissue at 
      25 degrees C than at 20 degrees C in one assay (S. zonale), and showed no
      difference in another assay (H. tuna). Moreover, when offered tissue coated with 
      lipophilic extracts of H. opuntia, northern herbivores consumed more
      extract-coated tissue at 25 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. In contrast to
      northern herbivores, the southern herbivores did not alter their feeding choices 
      with temperature. This study represents the first demonstration that short-term
      (i.e., days-long) variation in ambient temperature alters feeding choices in a
      marine herbivore.

TI  - The antigenotoxic activities of cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) cladodes against
      the mycotoxin zearalenone in Balb/c mice: prevention of micronuclei, chromosome
      aberrations and DNA fragmentation.
PG  - 662-7
LID - 10.1016/j.fct.2008.12.031 [doi]
AB  - Zearalenone (ZEN) is a potent estrogenic metabolite. Evidence of its cytotoxicity
      and genotoxicity has recently emerged from several reports. This study was
      conducted to evaluate the ability of cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) cladodes to
      protect Balb/c mice against ZEN induced genotoxicity. To this end, the effect of 
      a single dose of ZEN (40 mg/kg b.w.) alone and with extract of cactus cladodes
      (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg b.w.) was monitored by measuring: (i) micronuclei induction
      in bone marrow cells, (ii) chromosome aberrations mainly breaks and gaps in bone 
      marrow cells also and finally and (iii) DNA fragmentation in liver and kidney.
      Our results clearly show that ZEN is genotoxic to Balb/c mice. It induces DNA
      damage as indicated by DNA fragmentation, micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations
      in bone marrow cells. It is of note that cactus cladodes extract assayed alone at
      high dose (100 mg/kg b.w.) was found completely safe and did not induce any
      genotoxic effects. The simultaneous administration of cactus cladodes extract
      with ZEN resulted in an efficient prevention of micronuclei (the number of PCE MN
      decreased from 71.3+/-6.1 for animals treated with Zen to 32.6+/-15.5 for animals
      treated with cactus cladodes), chromosomal aberrations frequency (the % of
      chromosomal aberrations decreased from 38.3+/-3.0 to 18.6+/-1.1) in bone marrow
      cells and of DNA fragmentation compared to the group treated with ZEN alone. It
      could be concluded that cactus cladodes extract was effective in the protection
      against ZEN genotoxicity. This could be relevant, particularly with the emergent 
      demand for natural products which may neutralize the genotoxic effects of the
      multiple food contaminants.

AB  - Plant productivity in deserts may be more directly responsive to soil water
      availability than to precipitation. However, measurement of soil moisture alone
      may not be enough to elucidate plant responses to precipitation pulses, as
      edaphic factors may influence productivity when soil moisture is adequate. The
      first objective of the study was to determine the responses of the aboveground
      annual net primary productivity (ANPP) of three perennial species (from different
      functional groups) in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland to variation in natural
      precipitation (annual and seasonal) and a 25% increase in seasonal precipitation 
      (supplemental watering in summer and winter). Secondly, ANPP responses to other
      key environmental and soil parameters were explored during dry, average, and wet 
      years over a 5-yr period. ANPP predictors for each species were dynamic. High
      ANPP in Dasylirion leiophyllum was positively associated with higher soil NH(4)-N
      and frequent larger precipitation events, while that in Bouteloua curtipendula
      was positively correlated with frequent small summer precipitation events with
      short inter-pulse periods and supplemental winter water. Opuntia phaeacantha was 
      responsive to small precipitation events with short inter-pulse periods. Although
      several studies have shown ANPP increases with increases in precipitation and
      soil moisture in desert systems, this was not observed here as a universal
      predictor of ANPP, particularly in dry years.

TI  - Identification of factors influencing flight performance of field-collected and
      laboratory-reared, overwintered, and nonoverwintered cactus moths fed with
      field-collected host plants.
PG  - 1291-9
AB  - Environmental conditions during egg and larval development may influence the
      dispersal ability of insect pests, thus requiring seasonal adjustment of control 
      strategies. We studied the longest single flight, total distance flown, and the
      number of flights initiated by wild Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg) (Lepidoptera:
      Pyralidae) to determine whether the flight performance of overwintered cactus
      moths with a prolonged feeding phase during development differs from
      nonoverwintered cactus moths. Pupae of field-collected and laboratory-reared
      moths were transported together from the United States to Switzerland, and flight
      mills were used to characterize the flight capacity of 24- to 48-h-old adults
      during their most active period of the diel cycle. The lack of seasonal variation
      in flight performance of those moths that developed under controlled environment 
      but were fed with field-collected Opuntia cacti showed that seasonal changes in
      host plant quality did not affect flight. This consistent flight performance in
      the mass-reared laboratory population throughout the year is beneficial for
      sterile insect technique programs, which aim to limit the dispersal of this pest.
      For field-collected C. cactorum, the larger overwintered females performed
      similarly to nonoverwintered females, indicating that longer feeding time at
      lower temperature increases body size but does not influence female flight
      capacity. Young mated females had a similar flight capacity to unmated ones,
      suggesting that gravid females may play an important role in invading new
      habitats. For males, overwintering increased the proportion of long-distance
      flyers, suggesting that they are well-adapted to locate the more sparsely
      dispersed females in the spring.

AB  - Endemic Nesoryzomys swarthi and invasive Rattus rattus exist in unlikely sympatry
      in Galapagos as female N. swarthi suffer from competition with R. rattus. This
      study evaluates the role of feeding habits in facilitating their co-occurrence.
      Spool-and-line tracking of 85 N. swarthi and 33 R. rattus was used to quantify
      their selected diets, foods of which were used in captive trials of 46 N. swarthi
      and 34 R. rattus to quantify their preferred diets. Selected diets were compared 
      between species and seasons using niche measures, and contrasted to preferred
      diets to qualify inferences about competition. Diet overlap was highest in the
      wet season when food-particularly fruit-abundance was highest and R. rattus diet 
      breadth was broadest. Preferred and selected diets were marginally correlated for
      R. rattus but uncorrelated for N. swarthi, suggesting that R. rattus interfere
      with N. swarthi foraging. Diet overlap was highest between female N. swarthi and 
      R. rattus, perhaps due to female breeding requirements. Male N. swarthi avoided
      R. rattus-preferred foods, possibly to avoid aggressive encounters with R.
      rattus. During the dry season, when foods declined and the R. rattus population
      crashed, diet overlap was lowest as R. rattus diet narrowed in the absence of
      fruits. Female, and particularly male, N. swarthi diet broadened, with emphasis
      on acquiring Opuntia foods but N. swarthi-preferred and selected diets were
      uncorrelated, suggesting that their foraging was inhibited by R. rattus. In
      conclusion, the narrower diet breadth of R. rattus in contrast to N. swarthi
      suggests that this species may be less adapted to food acquisition at this site, 
      particularly when fruits are absent. The year-round presence of R. rattus,
      however, appears to inhibit N. swarthi foraging for its preferred diet, and they 
      instead specialise on Opuntia foods, which were uneaten by R. rattus and may
      provide N. swarthi with a localised competition refuge from encounters with R.
      rattus.

TI  - In vitro digestion of betalainic foods. Stability and bioaccessibility of
      betaxanthins and betacyanins and antioxidative potential of food digesta.
PG  - 10487-92
LID - 10.1021/jf8017172 [doi]
AB  - Betalains are considered to be bioactive dietary phytochemicals. The stability of
      betacyanins and betaxanthins from either fresh foods or manufactured products of 
      cactus pear fruit ( Opuntia ficus indica L. Mill. cv. Gialla and Rossa) and red
      beet ( Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris) was assessed in a simulated oral, gastric,
      and small intestinal digestion and compared with the digestive stability of
      purified pigments. A minor loss of indicaxanthin, at the gastric-like environment
      only, and a decrease of vulgaxanthin I through all digestion steps were observed,
      which was not affected by food matrix. In contrast, food matrix prevented decay
      of betanin and isobetanin at the gastric-like environment. Loss of betacyanins,
      either purified or food-derived, was observed during the small intestinal phase
      of digestion. Betalamic acid accumulated after digestive degradation of purified 
      pigments, but not of food betalains. Betaxanthins were wholly soluble in the
      aqueous (bioaccessible) fraction after ultracentrifugation of the postintestinal 
      (PI) digesta, whereas release of betacyanins from the matrix was incomplete. PI
      digesta inhibited dose-dependently the oxidation of methyl linoleate in methanol,
      an effect not correlated with the betalain content. The data suggest that
      digestive stability controls bioaccessibility of dietary betaxanthins, whereas
      additional factors, relevant to the food matrix and style of processing, affect
      betacyanin bioaccessibility.

      capacity measured with six different assays in eight horticultural crops.
PG  - 10498-504
LID - 10.1021/jf801983r [doi]
AB  - The contents of antioxidant nutritional compounds, total soluble phenolics (TSP),
      vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and total carotenoids (TC), were correlated 
      with the total antioxidant capacity (AOC) of hydrophilic (HPE) and lipophilic
      extracts (LPE) from eight horticultural crops, namely, guava, avocado, black
      sapote, mango, papaya, prickly pear fruit, cladodes, and strawberry. AOC was
      measured using six different assays: 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH),
      N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylendiamine (DMPD), ferric-ion-reducing antioxidant power
      (FRAP), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), Trolox equivalent antioxidant 
      capacity (TEAC), and total oxidant scavenging capacity (TOSC). AOC values from
      HPE were about 95 times higher than LPE values. HPE of guava had the highest AOC 
      value when evaluated with DMPD, DPPH, FRAP, TEAC, and TOSC assays, whereas with
      ORAC assay, black sapote had the highest value. HPE of papaya and prickly pear
      fruit presented the lowest AOC values with all assays. From HPE, vitamin C and
      TSP contents were highly correlated with AOC for all assays, while from LPE, TC
      and beta-carotene contents possessed a high correlation with AOC only in the DMPD
      assay.

TI  - Protective effect of cactus (Opuntia ficus indica) cladode extract upon
      nickel-induced toxicity in rats.
PG  - 3759-63
LID - 10.1016/j.fct.2008.09.059 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study carried out on male Wistar rats, was to evaluate the
      protective effects of regular ingestion of juice from the prickly pear cactus
      (Opuntia ficus indica) cladodes against nickel chloride toxicity. Rats were given
      either normal tap water or water containing 25% of cactus juice for one month.
      Then, rats of each group were injected daily, for 10 days, with either NiCl(2)
      solution (4mg (30micromol)/kg body weight) or with the same volume of saline
      solution (300mM NaCl). Significant increases of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate 
      aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase activities and of cholesterol,
      triglycerides and glucose levels were observed in blood of nickel-treated rats.
      In the liver, nickel chloride was found to induce an oxidative stress evidenced
      by an increase in lipid peroxidation and changes in antioxidant enzymes
      activities. Superoxide-dismutase (SOD) activity was found to be increased whereas
      glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities were decreased. These changes did 
      not occur in animals previously given cactus juice, demonstrating a protective
      effect of this vegetal extract.

TI  - Fungal control of pathogenic fungi isolated from wild plants in Taif Governorate,
      Saudia Arabia.
PG  - 90-6
AB  - Twenty two plants were collected from Taif Governorate and identified as:
      Euphorbia glomerifera, Juniperus procera, Launaea mucronata, Capparis dcidua,
      Punica granatum, Opuntia ficus, Prunus persica, Eucalyptus globulus, Medicago
      sativa, Artemisia monosperma, Trichodesma calathiforme, Artemisia judaica,
      Foeniculum vulgare, Phagnalon sinaicum, Rumex dentatus, Asphodelus aestives,
      Pulicaria crispa, Launae sonchoides, Forsskaolea tenacissima, Arnebia
      hispidissima, Avena spp and Aerva lanata. Pathogenic fungi were isolated from
      some of these plants and identified as Alternaria alternate, Ulocladium botrytis,
      Cladosporium spp, Cephalosporium spp, Penicillium chrysogenum, Fusarium oxysporum
      and Humicola grisea. Four antagonistic isolates were tested, 2 from Gliocladium
      fungus and 2 from Trichoderma fungus. We found that all the four antagonistic
      isolates (G. deliquescens, G. virens, T. viride and T. hamatum) significantly
      inhibited the radial growth of the pathogenic fungi tested, with different
      ratios. The results indicated that the antibiotics produced by the antagonists
      were more effective than the fungus itself and differ with different fungi.
      Coating plant stems with antagonists or with antagonist extracts reduce the
      severity of the disease but not prevent it in all tested pathogens.

TI  - Medicinal agents in the metabolic syndrome.
PG  - 237-52
AB  - The metabolic syndrome (MS) has become a worldwide health problem. It is
      difficult for patients to follow a diet/exercise regime that would improve their 
      symptoms, therefore the investigation of agents that may deal with its more
      serious aspects is an important medical field for research. The cardiovascular
      consequences associated with the syndrome and some of the therapeutic approaches 
      are discussed. The different agents can be divided into several groups:
      Inorganic/ organic: Zinc complexes with garlic components as insulino-mimetics;
      Selenium as antioxidant; Copper, Zinc and Manganese as microcomponents of
      antioxidant enzymes. Organic: Natural or Synthetic: Glycine is effective in
      lowering blood pressure, TBARS, intra-abdominal fat tissue and triglycerides in
      sucrose-fed rats. Pharmaceutical products: Fibrates, Lipid-lowering drugs.
      Antidiabetics. Anti-gout agents. On the other hand there are natural products
      such as those of animal origin: Sex hormones (also synthetic) used in the
      problems of menopause and hypoandrogenism frequently found in the MS, antioxidant
      Omega-3-oils (fish oils) or Vegetal: for example Digitalis pupurea, century-old
      cardiovascular medication as well as Magnolia officinalis; Spirulina maxima with 
      beneficial effects as antioxidant and lipid-lowering agent, among others. Prickly
      Pear Cacti. (Opuntia Ficus- Indica Cochlospermum vitifolium (Willd.) Spreng)
      whose many properties against diabetes and hypercholesterolemia have been
      empirically known for many years. Perezone (from Perezia plants, a.k.a. Peonia)
      described as an antiplatelet aggregating agent. The mixed elements in the
      Mediterranean diet: Fish, salads (peppers, tomatoes), olive oil, garlic, red wine
      which combines fish oils, garlic and avocado as well as antioxidants from the
      rest of its components.

TI  - The type and timing of social information alters offspring production.
PG  - 482-5
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2008.0306 [doi]
AB  - The acquisition and use of information are essential for decision-making in an
      uncertain world. The use of social information, or information from the behaviour
      of others, may be a common and efficient mechanism to improve estimates of
      resource quality by animals. According to theory, social information cues with
      higher information content should have a greater influence on decision-making,
      and current information should be weighed more than prior information. However,
      experimental tests of these hypotheses remain scarce. We exposed female cactus
      bugs (Chelinidea vittiger) to different types of social information (the presence
      of conspecific eggs or nymphs) presented at different times (current or prior to 
      egg laying) to determine the influence of social information on offspring
      production. We found that social information substantially altered the number of 
      eggs produced. The presence of conspecific eggs, regardless of timing,
      consistently increased egg production, whereas nymphs only increased egg
      production when present during egg laying. We conclude that the type and timing
      of social information may have an important, yet unappreciated, influence on
      reproductive allocation.

TI  - Toward understanding the efficacy and mechanism of Opuntia spp. as a natural
      coagulant for potential application in water treatment.
PG  - 4274-9
AB  - Historically, there is evidence to suggest that communities in the developing
      world have used plant-based materials as one strategy for purifying drinking
      water. In this study, the coagulant properties of Opuntia spp., a species of
      cactus, are quantitatively evaluated for the first time. Opuntia spp. was
      evaluated for turbidity removal from synthetic water samples, and steps were made
      toward elucidating the underlying coagulation mechanism. In model turbid water
      using kaolin clay particles at pH 10, Opuntia spp. reduced turbidity by 98% for a
      range of initial turbidities. This is similar to the observed coagulation
      activities previously described for Moringa oleifera, a widely studied natural
      coagulant. Although it has been reported that Moringa oleifera predominantly
      operates through charge neutralization, comparison of zeta potential measurements
      and transmission electron microscopy images of flocs formed by Opuntia spp.
      suggest that these natural coagulants operate through different mechanisms. It is
      suggested that Opuntia spp. operates predominantly through a bridging coagulation
      mechanism. Once optimized, application of these readily available plants as a
      part of point-of-use water treatment technology may offer a practical,
      inexpensive, and appropriate solution for producing potable water in some
      developing communities.

TI  - Macrophage immunomodulatory activity of polysaccharides isolated from Opuntia
      polyacantha.
PG  - 1455-66

AB  - Opuntia polyacantha (prickly pear cactus) has been used extensively for its
      nutritional properties; however, less is known regarding medicinal properties of 
      Opuntia tissues. In the present study, we extracted polysaccharides from O.
      polyacantha and used size-exclusion chromatography to fractionate the crude
      polysaccharides into four polysaccharide fractions (designated as Opuntia
      polysaccharides C-I to C-IV). The average M(r) of fractions C-I through C-IV was 
      estimated to be 733, 550, 310, and 168 kDa, respectively, and sugar composition
      analysis revealed that Opuntia polysaccharides consisted primarily of galactose, 
      galacturonic acid, xylose, arabinose, and rhamnose. Analysis of the effects of
      Opuntia polysaccharides on human and murine macrophages demonstrated that all
      four fractions had potent immunomodulatory activity, inducing production of
      reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and
      interleukin 6. Furthermore, modulation of macrophage function by Opuntia
      polysaccharides was mediated, at least in part, through activation of nuclear
      factor kappaB. Together, our results provide a molecular basis to explain a
      portion of the beneficial therapeutic properties of extracts from O. polyacantha 
      and support the concept of using Opuntia polysaccharides as an immunotherapeutic 
      adjuvant.

AB  - Qualitative and quantitative analyses of betalain pigments in 10 cultivars/lines 
      of prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) fruit grown in Mexico were conducted with reverse 
      phase high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD)
      coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Betacyanins and
      betaxanthins were identified by comparison with the UV/vis and mass spectrometric
      characteristics as well as the retention times of semisynthesized reference
      betaxanthins. Data revealed that the ratio and concentration of betalain pigments
      are responsible for the color in the different cultivars, showing the highest
      betalains content in the fruit of purple colored Camuesa (O. robusta Wendl.) (8.1
      mg/g dry fruit), which is comparable to that found in red beet Beta vulgaris L.
      ssp. Var. Pablo) (8.6 mg/g dry tissue). Yellow betalains were absent in Reyna (O.
      alba-carpa) prickly pear cultivar. A total of 24 known/unknown betalains were
      present in the prickly pear fruit samples studied, including 18 betaxanthins and 
      6 betacyanins. Our results indicate that prickly pear cultivars can be considered
      as a potential source of yellow and red natural colorants.

TI  - Mediterranean shrubs as potential antioxidant sources.
PG  - 689-708
LID - 10.1080/14786410801997125 [doi]
AB  - Several Mediterranean shrubs, both autochthonous and naturalized, have been
      traditionally used as food, flavouring and/or spicing agents, and as
      phytopharmaceuticals. The interest around 'natural' and 'biological' products is 
      steadily increasing in developed countries. Therefore, it seems reasonable to
      screen some shrubs with regard to the actual information about their content of
      phytochemicals, in relation to both real and putative beneficial properties, and 
      with particular concern to their 'antioxidant' power. Moreover, striking
      molecules from the examined shrubs are compared according to their occurrence in 
      the various genera. Also, their structures and structure/activity relationship
      are discussed in the light of possible practical application.

      populations.
PG  - 437-45
LID - 10.1007/s10519-008-9209-0 [doi]
AB  - Drosophila mettleri is found in deserts of North America breeding in soil soaked 
      by the juices of necrotic cacti. Saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) and cardon
      (Pachycereus pringlei) are the usual host cacti in Mexico and Arizona, while
      prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) is used by an isolated population on Santa Catalina
      Island off the southern California Coast. Populations of D. mettleri show
      significant local genetic differentiation, especially when geographical isolation
      is coupled with host shifts. We tested for evidence of sexual isolation among
      allopatric populations of D. mettleri using a variety of choice and no-choice
      tests. Populations exhibited significant differences in mating propensity, which 
      translated into significant deviations from random mating. While in some cases
      these deviations were consistent with sexual isolation, in others, negative
      assortative mating was observed. No relationship between degree of genetic
      differentiation and the appearance of sexual isolation was detected.

TI  - Efficacy of dietary supplementation with botanicals on carbohydrate metabolism in
      humans.
PG  - 78-81
AB  - Botanical products are widely used in nutritional supplementation for promotion
      of health or prevention of diseases. With the high prevalence of obesity and type
      2 diabetes, abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism are common in the general
      population and obtaining glycemic control is important in reducing the
      complications of diabetes. If shown to be effective, botanical products have a
      unique position in potentially aiding the general public in regard to obesity and
      diabetes. They can be obtained "over-the-counter" and may have less side effects 
      compared to many synthetic drugs. Although most of the popular botanicals have a 
      long history in folk medicine, there is paucity of data regarding their efficacy 
      and safety, particularly as it relates to human studies. In this review, we
      discuss the data that was available in the literature for nine botanicals that
      are frequently promoted to help manage blood glucose. They are Bitter Melon
      (Momordica charantia), Fenugreek (trigonella foenum graecum), Gymnema Sylvestre, 
      Ivy Gourd (Coccinia indica), Nopal or Prickly Pear Cactus (Opuntia
      streptacantha), Ginseng, Aloe Vera, Russian Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus), and
      Garlic (Allium sativum). The discussion is emphasized on the clinical aspect of
      these botanicals. Due to the lack of sufficient evidence from clinical studies
      for any of the botanicals reviewed, it is premature to actively recommend use of 
      any particular herb to treat either glucose or other risk factors. Thus, well
      defined randomized clinical trials are warranted in this area.

      analysis identifies new subgroups in the peanut witches'-broom phytoplasma group.
PG  - 1448-57
LID - 10.1099/ijs.0.65615-0 [doi]
AB  - Phytoplasmas were detected in cactus (Opuntia species) plants exhibiting
      witches'-broom disease symptoms in Yunnan Province, south-western China.
      Comparative and phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that
      an overwhelming majority of the cactus-infecting phytoplasmas under study
      belonged to the peanut witches'-broom phytoplasma group (16SrII). Genotyping
      through use of computer-simulated restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
      analysis of 16S rRNA genes revealed a remarkable genetic diversity among these
      cactus-infecting phytoplasma strains. Based on calculated coefficients of RFLP
      pattern similarities, seven new 16SrII subgroups were recognized, bringing the
      total of described group 16SrII subgroups to 12 worldwide. Geographical areas
      differed from one another in the extent of genetic diversity among
      cactus-infecting phytoplasma strains. The findings have implications for
      relationships between ecosystem distribution and the emergence of group 16SrII
      subgroup diversity.

TI  - The effect of cactus spines on light interception and Photosystem II for three
      sympatric species of Opuntia from the Mojave Desert.
PG  - 87-98
LID - 10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01110.x [doi]
AB  - Cactus spines reduce herbivory, direct water toward roots and reduce the impacts 
      of high- and low-temperature extremes. Yet, shading of stems by spines reduces
      incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PFD), photosynthesis and growth.
      This study compared spinescence, PFD interception, stem temperature, Photosystem 
      II (PSII) photochemistry and xanthophyll pigment composition for three species of
      cacti from the Mojave Desert, CA. The species vary in spinescence: Opuntia
      basilaris, which has no central or radial spines; Opuntia erinacea, which is
      densely covered with spines; and Opuntia phaeacantha, which has an intermediate
      coverage of spines. The role of spines was tested by removing spines from stems
      of O. erinacea. PFD interception was similar for both O. basilaris and O.
      phaeacantha, and about three times that for densely spined O. erinacea; removal
      of spines increased incident PFD three-fold. There were no effects of spines on
      stem temperatures. Steady-state light-response curves of chlorophyll a
      fluorescence from PSII indicated that PhiPSII, photochemical quenching (qP) and
      electron flux within PSII were lower, and non-photochemical quenching was higher,
      for O. erinacea in comparison to the other two species with less spines. After 2 
      months, qP was higher and electron flux lower, and xanthophyll pigment pool size 
      was higher, for stems from which spines had been removed compared with intact

      resulting in species-specific PFD interception, PSII photochemistry and
      xanthophyll pigment pool size, which may help maintain rates of photosynthesis
      during the hot, dry Mojave Desert summer.

AB  - Fermentation of juice and homogenized fruits of Opuntia stricta fruits has been
      developed and optimized. The aim was to obtain the red food colorant betanin from
      prickly pear, at high concentration and low viscosity. Among three strains
      assayed, Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. bayanus AWRI 796 has been the optimum for 
      this process. The optimum temperature value was found to be 35 degrees C for both
      sugar consumption and pigment preservation. After fermentation, biomass and
      residual vegetal tissue were discarded by centrifugation. Supernatant was
      concentrated under vacuum. Therefore, liquid concentrated betanin was obtained,
      with low viscosity and being sugar free. Besides, bioethanol was obtained as
      byproduct. Characteristics of the final product obtained were pH 3.41, 5.2
      degrees Brix, 9.65 g/L betanin, color strength of 10.8, and viscosity of 52.5 cP.
      These values are better than obtained by other procedures.

TI  - Diel flight pattern and flight performance of Cactoblastis cactorum (Lepidoptera:
      Pyralidae) measured on a flight mill: influence of age, gender, mating status,
      and body size.
PG  - 314-24
AB  - Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is an invasive herbivore
      that poses a serious risk to Opuntia cacti in North America. Knowledge of the
      flight behavior of the cactus moth is crucial for a better understanding of
      natural dispersal, and for both monitoring and control. We used computer-linked
      flight mills to investigate diel flight activity and flight performance in
      relation to gender, age, mating status, and body size. Maximal flight activity
      for both mated and unmated moths occurred during twilight, whereas flight
      activity was low during photophase. The total distance flown and the number of
      initiated flights within a diel cycle were higher in both unmated and mated
      females than in males, but the longest single flight was similar in both genders.
      These findings suggest that pheromone trap captures of males likely indicate the 
      simultaneous presence of females and that mated females might even be in areas
      where males are not detected yet. Flight performance heterogeneity was large,
      with a small portion of the population (both males and females) performing long
      unbroken flights, whereas the majority made short flights. Females had higher
      pupal and adult body size and shorter longevity than males. A few individuals,
      particularly young mated females, flying long distances may be important for
      active spread of a population and the colonization of new habitats. Implications 
      of this study in the control of the cactus moth by using the sterile insect
      technique are discussed.

TI  - Opuntia ficus indica's effect on heart-rate variability in high-level athletes.
PG  - 169-78
AB  - Opuntia ficus indica (OFI) has many physiological effects, but a relationship
      between OFI and heart-rate variability (HRV) has never been established. The aim 
      of this study was to describe the effects of a diet supplement of OFI on HRV in
      athletes. The first day, heart rate (HR) was measured at rest in supine (SU) and 
      standing (ST) positions to analyze HRV in 10 athletes, followed by a randomized
      assignment to an OFI (5) or placebo (5) group. The next day, the athletes
      repeated the HRV test. One month later the crossover protocol was applied. In
      OFI, the high-frequency-activity HF(SU) (1,773 +/- 2,927 vs. 5,856 +/- 8,326
      ms(2), p < .05), HF(ST) (295 +/- 313 vs. 560 +/- 515 ms(2), p < .05), and
      low-frequency LF(SU) (1,621 +/- 1,795 vs. 6,029 +/- 9,007 ms(2), p < .01)
      increased. HR(SU) (66 +/- 13 vs. 57 +/- 11 beats/min, p < .01) and HR(ST) (87 +/-
      11 vs. 76 +/- 9 beats/min, p < .01) decreased. A diet supplement of OFI increases
      HF and LF activities and decreases HR.

      developmental control of CAM expression during early growth of Clusia, Kalanchoe,
      and Opuntia.
PG  - 1829-40
LID - 10.1093/jxb/ern080 [doi]
AB  - The capacity to induce crassulacean acid metabolism developmentally (constitutive
      CAM) and to up-regulate CAM expression in response to drought stress (facultative
      CAM) was studied in whole shoots of seven species by measuring net CO(2) gas
      exchange for up to 120 day-night cycles during early growth. In Clusia rosea, CAM
      was largely induced developmentally. Well-watered seedlings began their life
      cycle as C(3) plants and developed net dark CO(2) fixation indicative of CAM
      after the initiation of the fourth leaf pair following the cotyledons.
      Thereafter, CAM activity increased progressively and drought stress led to only
      small additional, reversible increases in dark CO(2) fixation. In contrast, CAM
      expression was overwhelmingly under environmental control in seedlings and mature
      plants of Clusia pratensis. C(3)-type CO(2) exchange was maintained under
      well-watered conditions, but upon drought stress, CO(2) exchange shifted, in a
      fully reversible manner, to a CAM-type pattern. Clusia minor showed CO(2)
      exchange reponses intermediate to those of C. rosea and C. pratensis. Clusia
      cretosa operated in the C(3) mode at all times. Notably, reversible
      stress-induced increases of dark CO(2) fixation were also observed during the
      developmental progression to pronounced CAM in young Kalanchoe daigremontiana and
      Kalanchoe pinnata, two species considered constitutive CAM species.
      Drought-induced up-regulation of CAM was even detected in young cladodes of a
      cactus, Opuntia ficus-indica, an archetypal constitutive CAM species. Evidently, 
      the defining characteristics of constitutive and facultative CAM are shared, to
      variable degrees, by all CAM species.

      Anthropocene.
PG  - 1489-502
LID - 10.1093/jxb/ern052 [doi]
AB  - Having gained some understanding of the consequences of the CO(2)-concentrating
      mechanisms in crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) that internalize the
      photosynthetic environment of the Cretaceous on a daily basis, it may be time to 
      consider potential long-term effects of the planetary CO(2)-concentrating
      mechanism on growth and ecology of these plants in the Anthropocene. This paper
      emphasizes our limited understanding of the carbohydrate economy of CAM in
      relation to growth processes and briefly reviews recent studies of the diel
      cycles of growth in these plants. An inadvertent long-term, regional-scale
      experiment from the past is revisited in which an Opuntia monoculture grew to
      occupy >25 million hectares of farmland in central eastern Australia, producing a
      total biomass of about 1.5 billion tonnes in about 80 years. Although at the time
      it does not seem to have been recognized that this invasion involved CAM, a
      botanist from the University of Melbourne, Jean White-Haney emerges as a heroic
      pioneer in the control of the invader by poison and pioneered its biological
      control. The Opuntia population was expanding at 10-100 ha h(-1) when it was
      brought to a halt within a decade by the voracious appetite of Cactoblastis
      cactorum larvae. It is now known that the female parent moth of this predator
      detects CAM in O. stricta prior to oviposition by deploying the most sensitive
      CO(2) detector system yet found in the Lepidoptera. The O. stricta invasion is a 
      dramatic demonstration of the capacity of CAM plants to attain and sustain high
      biomass; to sequester and retain atmospheric CO(2). In conclusion, experiments
      are reviewed that show stimulation of CO(2) assimilation, growth, and biomass of 
      CAM plants by elevated atmospheric [CO(2)], and the proposition that these plants
      may have a role in atmospheric CO(2) sequestration is re-examined. This role may 
      be compromised by predators such as Cactoblastis. However the moth CO(2) sensors 
      are adapted to pre-industrial atmospheric [CO(2)] and FACE (free-air CO(2)
      enrichment) experiments show this exquisite system of biological control is also 
      compromised by rising global [CO(2)] in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Assessing the stable carbon isotopic composition of intercellular CO2 in a CAM
      plant using gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry.

LID - 10.1002/rcm.3460 [doi]
AB  - Most of the literature focused on internal CO(2) (Ci) determinations in plants
      has used indirect methods based on gas-exchange estimations. We have developed a 
      new method based on the capture of internal air gas samples and their analysis by
      gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). This
      method provided a direct measure of intercellular CO(2) concentrations combined
      with stable carbon isotopic composition in O. ficus-indica plants. Plants were
      grown at both ambient and elevated CO(2) concentration. During the day period,
      when the stomata are closed, the Ci was high and was very (13)C-enriched in both 
      ambient and elevated CO(2)-grown plants, reflecting Rubisco's fractionation (this
      plant enzyme has been shown to discriminate by 29 per thousand, in vitro, against
      (13)CO(2)). Other enzyme fractionations involved in C metabolism in plants, such 
      as carbonic anhydrase, could also be playing an important role in the diurnal
      delta(13)C enrichment of the Ci. During the night, when stomata are open, Ci
      concentrations were higher in elevated (and the corresponding delta(13)C values
      were more (13)C-depleted) than in ambient CO(2)-grown plants.

TI  - Cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) cladodes prevent oxidative damage induced by the
      mycotoxin zearalenone in Balb/C mice.
PG  - 1817-24

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEN) is one of the most widely distributed fusarial mycotoxins which
      is encountered at high incidence in many foodstuffs. ZEN was associated with
      different reproductive disorders in animals. Several in vivo studies have shown
      that ZEN is hepatotoxic, haematotoxic and causes several alterations of
      immunological parameters. Furthermore, evidence of its cytotoxicity and
      genotoxicity has recently emerged from several reports. The aim of the current
      study was (i) to find out whether oxidative stress could be relevant for ZEN
      induced toxicity in vivo using Balb/c mice and (ii) to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of cactus cladodes Opuntia ficus to prevent the deleterious effects of
      ZEN. To this end, the effect of a single dose of ZEN (40 mg/kg b.w.) alone and
      with extract of cactus cladodes (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg b.w.) on the induction of
      oxidative stress was monitored in kidney and liver by measuring the MDA level,
      the protein carbonyls generation, the catalase activity and the expression of the
      heat shock proteins (Hsp). Our results clearly showed that ZEN induced
      significant alterations in all tested oxidative stress markers. Oxidative damage 
      seems to be a key determinant of ZEN induced toxicity in both liver and kidney of
      Balb/c mice. The combined treatment of ZEN with the lowest tested dose of cactus 
      extracts (25 mg/kg b.w.) showed a total reduction of ZEN induced oxidative damage
      for all tested markers. It could be concluded that cactus cladodes extract was
      effective in the protection against ZEN hazards. This could be relevant,
      particularly with the emergent demand for natural products which may counteract
      the detrimental effects of oxidative stress and therefore prevent multiple human 
      diseases.

TI  - Herbivore-mediated ecological costs of reproduction shape the life history of an 
      iteroparous plant.
PG  - 141-9
LID - 10.1086/524961 [doi]
AB  - Plant reproduction yields immediate fitness benefits but can be costly in terms
      of survival, growth, and future fecundity. Life-history theory posits that
      reproductive strategies are shaped by trade-offs between current and future
      fitness that result from these direct costs of reproduction. Plant reproduction
      may also incur indirect ecological costs if it increases susceptibility to
      herbivores. Yet ecological costs of reproduction have received little empirical
      attention and remain poorly integrated into life-history theory. Here, we provide
      evidence for herbivore-mediated ecological costs of reproduction, and we develop 
      theory to examine how these costs influence plant life-history strategies. Field 
      experiments with an iteroparous cactus (Opuntia imbricata) indicated that greater
      reproductive effort (proportion of meristems allocated to reproduction) led to
      greater attack by a cactus-feeding insect (Narnia pallidicornis) and that damage 
      by this herbivore reduced reproductive success. A dynamic programming model
      predicted strongly divergent optimal reproductive strategies when ecological
      costs were included, compared with when these costs were ignored. Meristem
      allocation by cacti in the field matched the optimal strategy expected under
      ecological costs of reproduction. The results indicate that plant reproductive
      allocation can strongly influence the intensity of interactions with herbivores
      and that associated ecological costs can play an important selective role in the 
      evolution of plant life histories.

TI  - Contrasting effects of invasive plants in plant-pollinator networks.
PG  - 761-70
LID - 10.1007/s00442-007-0946-1 [doi]
AB  - The structural organization of mutualism networks, typified by interspecific
      positive interactions, is important to maintain community diversity. However,
      there is little information available about the effect of introduced species on
      the structure of such networks. We compared uninvaded and invaded ecological
      communities, to examine how two species of invasive plants with large and showy
      flowers (Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis and Opuntia stricta) affect the
      structure of Mediterranean plant-pollinator networks. To attribute differences in
      pollination to the direct presence of the invasive species, areas were surveyed
      that contained similar native plant species cover, diversity and floral
      composition, with or without the invaders. Both invasive plant species received
      significantly more pollinator visits than any native species and invaders
      interacted strongly with pollinators. Overall, the pollinator community richness 
      was similar in invaded and uninvaded plots, and only a few generalist pollinators
      visited invasive species exclusively. Invasive plants acted as pollination super 
      generalists. The two species studied were visited by 43% and 31% of the total
      insect taxa in the community, respectively, suggesting they play a central role
      in the plant-pollinator networks. Carpobrotus and Opuntia had contrasting effects
      on pollinator visitation rates to native plants: Carpobrotus facilitated the
      visit of pollinators to native species, whereas Opuntia competed for pollinators 
      with native species, increasing the nestedness of the plant-pollinator network.
      These results indicate that the introduction of a new species to a community can 
      have important consequences for the structure of the plant-pollinator network.

AB  - The increasingly diverse U.S. immigrant populations and the growing use of
      medicinal herbs create a need for health care professionals to expand their
      knowledge in this area. This is a review of tropical plants, Annona Muricata,
      Artemisia absinthium, Cinchona officinalis, Illicium verum, Momordica charantia, 
      Opuntia streptacantha, Schinus terebinthifolius, and Tabebuia avellanedae
      (impetiginosa), commonly used by Latino and Haitian populations for the treatment
      of infectious disease. All the eight plants discussed here have one or more of
      the following: antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, or antiparasitic properties.
      All of these plants are primarily known and used in the tropical region, but they
      are also readily available for purchase in the United States, specifically in the
      ethnic markets. This review discusses their traditional uses, chemical
      constituents, proven scientific evidence, and toxicities.

TI  - Wing morphology and fluctuating asymmetry depend on the host plant in cactophilic
      Drosophila.
PG  - 598-609
AB  - As in most insect groups, host plant shifts in cactophilic Drosophila represent
      environmental challenges as flies must adjust their developmental programme to
      the presence of different chemical compounds and/or to a microflora that may
      differ in the diversity and abundance of yeasts and bacteria. In this context,
      wing morphology provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the factors that
      may induce changes during development. In this work, we investigated phenotypic
      plasticity and developmental instability of wing morphology in flies on the
      cactophilic Drosophila buzzatii and Drosophila koepferae raised on alternative
      breeding substrates. We detected significant differences in wing size between and
      within species, and between flies reared on different cactus hosts. However,
      differences in wing shape between flies emerged from different cactus hosts were 
      not significant either in D. buzzatii or in D. koepferae. Our results also showed
      that morphological responses involved the entire organ, as variation in size and 
      shape correlated between different portions of the wing. Finally, we studied the 
      effect of the rearing cactus host on developmental instability as measured by the
      degree of fluctuating asymmetry (FA). Levels of FA in wing size were
      significantly greater in flies of both species reared in non-preferred when
      compared with those reared in preferred host cacti. Our results are discussed in 
      the framework of an integrative view aimed at investigating the relevance of host
      plant shifts in the evolution of the guild of cactophilic Drosophila species that
      diversified in South America.

TI  - Salt stress increases the expression of p5cs gene and induces proline
      accumulation in cactus pear.
PG  - 82-92
AB  - Proline (Pro) is one of the most accumulated osmolytes in salinity and water
      deficit conditions in plants. In the present study, we measured the Pro content, 
      the activity and the expression level of delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
      synthetase (P5CS: gamma-glutamyl kinase, EC 2.7.2.11 and glutamate-5-semialdehyde
      dehydrogenase, EC 1.2.1.41), a key regulatory enzyme involved in the biosynthesis
      of Pro, in cactus pear (Opuntia streptacantha) subjected to 6, 9 and 11 days of
      salt stress. Treatment with NaCl of O. streptacantha young plants resulted in a
      decrease in the cladode thickness and root length, and in a significant and
      gradual accumulation of Pro in young cladodes, in a time- and
      concentration-dependent manner. P5CS activity, studied as gamma-glutamyl kinase, 
      was reduced at all times as a consequence of salt treatment, except at the sixth 
      day at 75 and 150mM of NaCl, where a slight increase was observed. We isolated an
      open reading frame (ORF) fragment of p5cs gene. The deduced amino acid sequence
      of the P5CS protein exhibited 90.4% of identity with the P5CS protein from
      Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the Osp5cs gene of
      O. streptacantha was induced by salt stress at 9 and 11 days of treatment.
      Furthermore, ABA-induced Osp5cs gene expression was observed in cladodes of
      cactus pear young plants. We observed an evident correlation between the
      transcript up-regulation and the Pro accumulation under salt stress; however,
      these results do not parallel with the changes in P5CS enzymatic activity. This
      Pro accumulation might function as an osmolyte for the intracellular osmotic
      adjustment and might be playing a critical role in protecting photosynthetic
      activity in O. streptacantha plants under salt stress.

      basis for their use as home remedies. It is generally accepted by many people in 
      Mexico and elsewhere in the world that beneficial medicinal effects can be
      obtained by ingesting plant products. In this review, we focus on the potential
      pharmacologic bases for herbal plant efficacy, but we also raise concerns about
      the safety of these agents, which have not been fully assessed. Although numerous
      randomized clinical trials of herbal medicines have been published and systematic
      reviews and meta-analyses of these studies are available, generalizations about
      the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines are clearly not possible. Recent
      publications have also highlighted the unintended consequences of herbal product 
      use, including morbidity and mortality. It has been found that many
      phytochemicals have pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions with drugs.
      The present review is limited to some herbal medicines that are native or
      cultivated in Mexico and that have significant use. We discuss the cultural uses,
      phytochemistry, pharmacological, and toxicological properties of the following
      plant species: nopal (Opuntia ficus), peppermint (Mentha piperita), chaparral
      (Larrea divaricata), dandlion (Taraxacum officinale), mullein (Verbascum
      densiflorum), chamomile (Matricaria recutita), nettle or stinging nettle (Urtica 
      dioica), passionflower (Passiflora incarnata), linden flower (Tilia europea), and
      aloe (Aloe vera). We conclude that our knowledge of the therapeutic benefits and 
      risks of some herbal medicines used in Mexico is still limited and efforts to
      elucidate them should be intensified.

TI  - The effect of NeOpuntia on blood lipid parameters--risk factors for the metabolic
      syndrome (syndrome X).
PG  - 1115-25
AB  - Metabolic syndrome (syndrome X) causes millions of cardiovascular complications
      and premature deaths every year. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      effects of NeOpuntia, patented, dehydrated, Opuntia ficus-indica leaves, on blood
      lipid parameters and metabolic syndrome. Opuntia ficus-indica leaves are
      traditionally consumed as a vegetable. Participants in this monocentric,
      randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blind, 6-wk study were 68 women, ages 20 to
      55 y, with metabolic syndrome and a body mass index between 25 and 40. Fifty-nine
      subjects completed the study according to the study plan. All volunteers followed
      wellbalanced diets with controlled lipid input. NeOpuntia or placebo capsules
      were taken at a dosage of 1.6 g per meal. All 5 syndrome X criteria were measured
      on days 0, 14, and 42, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
      highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride levels. For the 42 
      females above 45 y of age, we show a significant increase in HDL-C levels with
      NeOpuntia and a tendency toward decreased triglyceride levels. At the same time, 
      there was a decrease in HDL-C levels with placebo. Overall, for the entire study 
      population, similar but less pronounced tendencies were demonstrated. Forty-two
      females taking NeOpuntia with no additional hypolipemic treatment, had a
      pronounced reduction in LDL cholesterol, especially after day 14. At the study
      end, 39% of the NeOpuntia group, but only 8% of the placebo group, were no longer
      diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Our results indicate an advantage of using
      NeOpuntia in dietary supplements and functional foods because of improvement of
      blood lipid parameters associated with cardiovascular risks.

TI  - Opuntia ficus indica extract protects against chlorpyrifos-induced damage on mice
      liver.
PG  - 797-802
AB  - This original study investigates the role of Opuntia ficus indica (cactus)
      cladodes extract against liver damage induced in male SWISS mice by an
      organophosphorous insecticide, the chlorpyrifos (CPF). Liver damage was evaluated
      by the measure of its weight and the quantification of some biochemical
      parameters, such as alanine amino transferase (ALAT), aspartate amino transferase
      (ASAT), phosphatase alkaline (PAL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cholesterol and 
      albumin in serum by spectrophotometric techniques. The experimental approach
      lasted 48 h and consisted of 6 treatments of six mice each one; (1) control, (2) 
      10 mg/kg (b.w) CPF, (3) 10mg/kg (b.w) CPF with 100 mg/kg (b.w) cactus, (4) 150
      mg/kg (b.w)CPF, (5) 150 mg/kg (b.w) CPF with 1.5 g/kg cactus, (6) 1.5 g/kg
      cactus. Both chlorpyrifos and cactus were administrated orally via gavages. Our
      results showed that CPF affects significantly all parameters studied. However,
      when this pesticide was administrated associated to cactus, we noticed a recovery
      of all their levels. In the other hand, cactus alone did not affect the studied
      parameters. These results allow us to conclude firstly that CPF is hepatotoxic
      and secondly that Opuntia ficus indica stem extract protects the liver and
      decreases the toxicity induced by this organophosphorous pesticide.

TI  - [Determination of trace elements in new food sources by flame atomic absorption
      spectrophotometry].
PG  - 1436-9
AB  - Samples were digested by HNO3 + HClO4. Flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry 
      (FAAS) was successfully used to determine copper, zinc and iron in new resource
      food. Under our experimental conditions, the recovery ratio was 94.66%-108.80%;
      the precision was 0.71%-4.78%. This method of measuring elements is convenient,
      rapid and accurate. The results showed that there are profitable elements, such
      as copper, zinc and iron in new resourse food in Henan province. By F test and
      SNK test, the content sequence of metal elements was found as follows: copper,

TI  - Preventing establishment: an inventory of introduced plants in Puerto Villamil,
      Isabela Island, Galapagos.
PG  - e1042
AB  - As part of an island-wide project to identify and eradicate potentially invasive 
      plant species before they become established, a program of inventories is being
      carried out in the urban and agricultural zones of the four inhabited islands in 
      Galapagos. This study reports the results of the inventory from Puerto Villamil, 
      a coastal village representing the urban zone of Isabela Island. We visited all
      1193 village properties to record the presence of the introduced plants. In
      addition, information was collected from half of the properties to determine
      evidence for potential invasiveness of the plant species. We recorded 261
      vascular taxa, 13 of which were new records for Galapagos. Most of the species
      were intentionally grown (cultivated) (73.3%) and used principally as
      ornamentals. The most frequent taxa we encountered were Cocos nucifera (coconut
      tree) (22.1%) as a cultivated plant and Paspalum vaginatum (salt water couch)
      (13.2%) as a non cultivated plant. In addition 39 taxa were naturalized. On the
      basis of the invasiveness study, we recommend five species for eradication
      (Abutilon dianthum, Datura inoxia, Datura metel, Senna alata and Solanum
      capsicoides), one species for hybridization studies (Opuntia ficus-indica) and
      three species for control (Furcraea hexapetala, Leucaena leucocephala and
      Paspalum vaginatum).

TI  - Serendipitous backyard hybridization and the origin of crops.
PG  - 14389-94
AB  - Backyard gardens, dump heaps, and kitchen middens are thought to have provided
      important venues for early crop domestication via generation of hybrids between
      otherwise isolated plant species. However, this process has rarely been
      demonstrated empirically. For the majority of polyploid crops, it remains
      uncertain to what extent hybridization and polyploidization preceded
      domestication or were precipitated by human activities. Using archaeological,
      ethnobotanical, geographical, and genetic data, we investigate the extent and
      significance of predomestication cultivation, backyard sympatry, and spontaneous 
      hybridization for the Mimosoid legume tree Leucaena, which is used as a food crop
      throughout south-central Mexico. We show that predomestication cultivation was
      widespread, involved numerous independent transitions from the wild to
      cultivation, and resulted in extensive artificial sympatry of 2-6 species locally
      and 13 species in total. Using chloroplast and rapidly evolving nuclear-encoded
      DNA sequences, we demonstrate that hybridization in Leucaena has been extensive
      and complex, spawning a diverse set of novel hybrids as a result of juxtaposition
      of species in cultivation. The scale and complexity of hybridization in Leucaena 
      is significantly greater than that documented for any other Mexican plant
      domesticates so far. However, there are striking parallels between Leucaena and
      the other major Mexican perennial domesticates Agave and Opuntia, which show very
      similar domestication via backyard hybridization pathways. Our results suggest
      that backyard hybridization has played a central role in Mesoamerican crop
      domestication and demonstrate that the simple step of bringing species together
      in cultivation can provide a potent trigger for domestication.

TI  - Physicochemical characterization of nopal pads (Opuntia ficus indica) and dry
      vacuum nopal powders as a function of the maturation.
PG  - 107-12
AB  - This paper presents the physicochemical and nutrimental characterization of fresh
      nopal (Opuntia ficus indica, Redonda variety) and nopal powder produced at
      different stages of development. Nopal powder was obtained by dry vacuum
      technique using 10(2) Torr and low temperature (40 degrees C). The results showed
      that the nutrimental and mineral composition of nopal changes as a function of
      the maturation as follow: The ash content increases from 18.41 for nopalitos (60 
      g of weight) to 23.24% (nopal pads 200 g); calcium content increases from 1.52 to
      3.72%, while phosphorous exhibits an opposite trend: 0.43 to 0.27%, respectively.
      Calcium oxalate was determined by X-ray diffraction and SEM microscopy and
      quantified by using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Calcium oxalate decreases
      from 7.95 to 3.47 mg/g and the Ca/P ratio varies from 3.6 to 11. The soluble
      fibre decreases from 25.22 to 14.91%, while insoluble fibre increases from 29.87 
      to 41.65%. These results suggest that nopal could be an important source of
      minerals within the diets of people in Mexico and the rest of Latin America.

TI  - Mechanisms of water economy in lactating Ethiopian Somali goats during repeated
      cycles of intermittent watering.
PG  - 1009-17
LID - 10.1017/S1751731107000353 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the physiological and behavioural strategies by which lactating
      Ethiopian Somali goats endure repeated periods of water deprivation. The
      experiment lasted for 32 days and was divided into four periods of 8 days each.
      Measurements were taken during the first 4 days in each period. Seven does (W1)
      were watered once daily and seven does (W4) were watered once every 4th day.
      Rectal temperature was taken at 0800 and 1715 h. Blood samples were taken in the 
      evening and milk samples in the morning. The goats were on pasture between 0900
      to 1215 h and 1315 to 1630 h with behaviour recorded every 5 min. The does were
      supplemented with 300 g of concentrates per head per day. Plasma and milk
      osmolality were determined by freezing point depression. Plasma total protein was
      measured on a TS refractometer. Plasma vasopressin concentrations were analysed
      by radio-immunoassay. The mean daily water intake of W1 was 1897 ml compared with
      the calculated mean of 1075 ml in W4 (P < 0.001). The mean diurnal variation of
      the rectal temperature was 3.5 degrees C in both groups. Afternoon rectal
      temperature in W4 during period 1 was higher than that in the W1 on the days of
      water deprivation (P < 0.05). With repeated periods, plasma osmolality in W4
      increased less over the days of water deprivation. It was 336, 321, 311 and 306
      mosm/l on the 4th day at periods 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The corresponding
      vasopressin concentrations were 10.0, 9.2, 4.2 and 4.4 pmol/l. Total plasma
      protein concentration during period 1 on days 3 and 4 were higher in W4 than in
      W1 (P < 0.01). During the subsequent periods, it did not increase more in W4
      compared with W1, but it was lower in W4 on the days after watering. W4 milk
      production decreased by 22% compared with W1 in all periods. With increasing days
      of water deprivation, the W4 goats spent less time in the sun, grazed shorter
      time and frequently ate cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) as compared with W1.
      Results suggested that dehydrated lactating Ethiopian Somali goats economised on 
      water by diurnal variations of rectal temperature, storing water in the
      extracellular fluid, by changing behaviour at grazing and by decreasing milk
      production.

TI  - Chemical composition and antifungal activity of volatiles from three Opuntia
      species growing in Tunisia.
PG  - 2485-9
AB  - The chemical composition of the volatiles isolated by steam distillation from
      leaves, flowers and fruits of Opuntia lindheimeri var. linguiformis L. Benson,
      leaves and flowers of Opuntia macrorhiza Engelm and leaves of Opuntia microdasys 
      (Lehmann) gathered in the sea cliff of Monastir town (Tunisia), has been studied 
      by GC and GC-MS. Remarkable differences were noted between the composition and
      the constituent percentage of the different studied organs. The most important
      compounds found in leaves, flowers and fruits of Opuntia lindheimeri var.
      linguiformis were tetradecanoic acid (3.15-13.57%), hexadecanoic acid
      (8.5-17.33%), butyl tetradecanoate (8.05-21.47%) and (E)-3-Butyldiene phthalide
      (6.92-15.77%). In the flowers volatile extract of Opuntia macrorhiza, the main
      compound found was Butyl tetradecanoate (21.14%). The volatile extract from
      Opuntia microdasys leaves was mainly rich in hexadecanoic acid (13.13%),
      (E)-3-Butyldiene phthalide (21.4%) and butyl tetradecanoate (5.91%). Volatile
      components extracts were tested against the fungi Alternaria solani, Botrytis
      cinerea, Fusarium solani f. sp cucurbitae, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp niveum,
      Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani. The strongest inhibitory effect of the
      all volatile extracts was observed against

TI  - Changes in respiratory mitochondrial machinery and cytochrome and alternative
      pathway activities in response to energy demand underlie the acclimation of
      respiration to elevated CO2 in the invasive Opuntia ficus-indica.
PG  - 49-61
AB  - Studies on long-term effects of plants grown at elevated CO(2) are scarce and
      mechanisms of such responses are largely unknown. To gain mechanistic
      understanding on respiratory acclimation to elevated CO(2), the Crassulacean acid
      metabolism Mediterranean invasive Opuntia ficus-indica Miller was grown at
      various CO(2) concentrations. Respiration rates, maximum activity of cytochrome c
      oxidase, and active mitochondrial number consistently decreased in plants grown
      at elevated CO(2) during the 9 months of the study when compared to ambient
      plants. Plant growth at elevated CO(2) also reduced cytochrome pathway activity, 
      but increased the activity of the alternative pathway. Despite all these effects 
      seen in plants grown at high CO(2), the specific oxygen uptake rate per unit of
      active mitochondria was the same for plants grown at ambient and elevated CO(2). 
      Although decreases in photorespiration activity have been pointed out as a factor
      contributing to the long-term acclimation of plant respiration to growth at
      elevated CO(2), the homeostatic maintenance of specific respiratory rate per unit
      of mitochondria in response to high CO(2) suggests that photorespiratory activity
      may play a small role on the long-term acclimation of respiration to elevated
      CO(2). However, despite growth enhancement and as a result of the inhibition in
      cytochrome pathway activity by elevated CO(2), total mitochondrial ATP production
      was decreased by plant growth at elevated CO(2) when compared to ambient-grown
      plants. Because plant growth at elevated CO(2) increased biomass but reduced
      respiratory machinery, activity, and ATP yields while maintaining O(2)
      consumption rates per unit of mitochondria, we suggest that acclimation to
      elevated CO(2) results from physiological adjustment of respiration to tissue ATP
      demand, which may not be entirely driven by nitrogen metabolism as previously
      suggested.

TI  - The effect of ultraviolet-depleted light on the flavonol contents of the cactus
      species Opuntia wilcoxii and Opuntia violacea.
PG  - 1525-32
AB  - An early investigation at the Biosphere-2 Laboratory, an artificial ecosystem in 
      the Arizona desert, had shown that the flavonoid content of cacti grown in
      glass-filtered solar light was lower than of cacti grown in normal solar light.
      This was attributed to the absence of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is
      required for flavonoid biosynthesis. In this study, two species of Opuntia cacti 
      were grown in solar and UV-depleted light, and their flavonol contents of
      different tissues were determined by HPLC. O. wilcoxii, previously raised in the 
      absence of UV light, was exposed to normal solar light. The flavonol content of
      young O. wilcoxii pads was 28-fold higher when grown in solar light as compared
      to UV-depleted light. The flavonol contents of mature outer tissues were only
      slightly higher. O. violacea, previously raised in solar light, was also
      maintained in the same UV-depleted artificial ecosystem. The flavonol content
      after hydrolysis of outer tissues was similar, whether grown in solar light or
      UV-depleted light. We attribute these responses to different biosynthetic and
      metabolic rates of young vs. mature plant tissues; slow-growing mature tissues
      neither produce nor metabolize compounds as quickly as immature tissues. These
      findings indicate that artificial ecosystems can influence the production of
      natural products in cultivated plants.

TI  - Demographic models reveal the shape of density dependence for a specialist insect
      herbivore on variable host plants.
PG  - 722-9
AB  - 1. It is widely accepted that density-dependent processes play an important role 
      in most natural populations. However, persistent challenges in our understanding 
      of density-dependent population dynamics include evaluating the shape of the
      relationship between density and demographic rates (linear, concave, convex), and
      identifying extrinsic factors that can mediate this relationship. 2. I studied
      the population dynamics of the cactus bug Narnia pallidicornis on host plants
      (Opuntia imbricata) that varied naturally in relative reproductive effort (RRE,
      the proportion of meristems allocated to reproduction), an important plant
      quality trait. I manipulated per-plant cactus bug densities, quantified
      subsequent dynamics, and fit stage-structured models to the experimental data to 
      ask if and how density influences demographic parameters. 3. In the field
      experiment, I found that populations with variable starting densities quickly
      converged upon similar growth trajectories. In the model-fitting analyses, the
      data strongly supported a model that defined the juvenile cactus bug retention
      parameter (joint probability of surviving and not dispersing) as a nonlinear
      decreasing function of density. The estimated shape of this relationship shifted 
      from concave to convex with increasing host-plant RRE. 4. The results demonstrate
      that host-plant traits are critical sources of variation in the strength and
      shape of density dependence in insects, and highlight the utility of integrated
      experimental-theoretical approaches for identifying processes underlying patterns
      of change in natural populations.

TI  - Occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in artisanal Palmero cheese smoked
      with two types of vegetable matter.
PG  - 2717-25
AB  - Palmero cheese is a fresh smoked cheese from the Isle of Palma (Canary Islands), 
      manufactured with goat's milk. To guarantee its safety, the occurrence of
      polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in artisanal Palmero cheese smoked with 2 
      types of vegetable matter (almond shells and dry prickly pear) was studied. The
      determination of PAH includes extraction and clean-up steps, followed by
      separation, identification, and quantification of PAH by gas chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry in selected ion-monitoring mode. The most abundant PAH are those
      with 2 and 3 aromatic rings. Although the highest total PAH concentrations
      corresponded to the cheeses smoked with almond shells, the degree of PAH
      contamination of the cheeses studied was lower than that found in other cheeses
      smoked in the traditional way. The nature of the vegetable material used for
      smoking seemed to have an influence on the type of PAH formed, especially on
      alkylderivatives and some light PAH. However, despite the artisanal, and
      consequently variable, production process of these cheeses, many similarities
      have been found among their PAH profiles. In fact, relatively constant
      relationships are observed between the concentrations of certain pairs of PAH.
      Benzo(a)pyrene was only present in 2 samples, and in much lower concentrations
      than the maximum allowed legal limits. Therefore, according to the results
      obtained, it appears that it is possible to obtain a safe product without
      renouncing the artisanal character or the sensory properties of this type of
      cheese.

TI  - Experimental binding of lead to a low cost on biosorbent: Nopal (Opuntia
      streptacantha).
PG  - 1211-7
AB  - The use of nopal cladodes (Opuntia streptacantha) as raw material for Pb(2+)
      biosorption was investigated. Batch experiments were carried out to determine
      Pb(2+) sorption capacity and the efficiency of the sorption process under
      different pH, initial Pb(2+) and nopal biomass concentrations. The experimental
      data showed a good fit to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms models. The maximum
      adsorption capacity for Pb(2+) was 0.14 mmol g(-1) with an efficiency higher than
      94% (pH 5.0 and 2.5 g L(-1) nopal biomass). The Pb(2+) kinetics were best
      described by the pseudo-second-order rate model. The rate constant, the initial
      sorption rate and the equilibrium sorption capacity were determined. The
      practical implication of this study is the development of an effective and
      economic technology in which the nopal biomass did not undergo any chemical or
      physical pretreatment, which added to nopal abundance in Mexico and its low cost 
      makes it a good option for Pb(2+) removal from contaminated waters.

TI  - Betanin a betacyanin pigment purified from fruits of Opuntia ficus-indica induces
      apoptosis in human chronic myeloid leukemia Cell line-K562.
PG  - 739-46
AB  - Betalains are water-soluble nitrogenous vacuolar pigments present in flowers and 
      fruits of many caryophyllales with potent antioxidant properties. In the present 
      study the antiproliferative effects of betanin, a principle betacyanin pigment,
      isolated from the fruits of Opuntia ficus-indica, was evaluated on human chronic 
      myeloid leukemia cell line (K562). The results show dose and time dependent
      decrease in the proliferation of K562 cells treated with betanin with an IC(50)
      of 40 microM. Further studies involving scanning and transmission electron
      microscopy revealed the apoptotic characteristics such as chromatin condensation,
      cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing. Agarose electrophoresis of genomic DNA of
      cells treated with betanin showed fragmentation pattern typical for apoptotic
      cells. Flow cytometric analysis of cells treated with 40 microM betanin showed
      28.4% of cells in sub G0/G1 phase. Betanin treatment to the cells also induced
      the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, poly (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP)
      cleavage, down regulation Bcl-2, and reduction in the membrane potentials.
      Confocal microscopic studies on the cells treated with betanin suggest the entry 
      of betanin into the cells. These studies thus demonstrate that betanin induces
      apoptosis in K562 cells through the intrinsic pathway and is mediated by the
      release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, and PARP cleavage.
      The antiproliferative effects of betanin add further value to the nutritional
      characteristics of the fruits of O. ficus-indica.

TI  - Monitoring by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry the impact of pH
      and temperature on the pigment pattern of cactus pear fruit extracts.
PG  - 120-5
AB  - The influence of pH and moderate heating (50 degrees C) on the color and
      individual betacyanin content of pigment extracts from cactus pear fruits
      (Opuntia stricta) is studied in the course of this paper. The study is carried
      out by using a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a photodiode
      array detector and coupled to a mass spectrometer. The results point to a
      pH-dependent degradation mechanism, which is reflected in the chromatographic
      patterns obtained at different exposure times (0-28 h). At pH 3,
      15-descarboxy-betanin is the most resistant betacyanin derivative. At pH 5, seven
      peaks are detected after 8 h, the most prominent being betanin,
      cyclo-dopa-5-O-beta-glucoside, and betalamic. In the assay conducted at pH 7,
      rapid color loss affects all the pigments, except for betanin.

TI  - Common subtropical and tropical nonpollen food sources of the boll weevil
      (Coleoptera: Curculionidae).
PG  - 99-104
AB  - It is known that substantial boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman,
      individuals can survive mild subtropical winters in some habitats, such as citrus
      orchards. Our study shows that endocarp of the fruit from prickly pear cactus,
      Opuntia engelmannii Salm-Dyck ex. Engel.; orange, Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck.; and
      grapefruit, Citrus paradisi Macfad., can sustain newly emerged adult boll weevils
      for >5 mo, which is the duration of the cotton-free season in the subtropical
      Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas and other cotton-growing areas in the Western
      Hemisphere. Cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., and the boll weevil occur in the same 
      areas with one or all three plant species (or other citrus and Opuntia species
      that might also nourish boll weevils) from south Texas to Argentina. Although
      adult boll weevils did not produce eggs when fed exclusively on the endocarps of 
      prickly pear, orange, or grapefruit, these plants make it possible for boll
      weevils to survive from one cotton growing season to the next, which could pose
      challenges to eradication efforts.

TI  - Aggregation pheromone of Metamasius spinolae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae):
      chemical analysis and field test.
PG  - 53-7
AB  - Male Metamasius spinolae (Gylh.) produce several volatile compounds that are
      likely constituents of its aggregation pheromone. These compounds were identified
      by volatile collections and gas chromatography (GC), followed by coupled gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), as 2-methyl-4-heptanone [1],
      6-methyl-2hepten-4-one [2], and 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-heptanone [3]. Preliminary
      field experiments using synthetic racemates of these compounds showed that
      significantly more adult cactus weevils were caught in traps baited with the
      major single compound three or the 2 + 3 binary combination than in unbaited
      control traps. However, highest trap efficacy occurred with the 1 + 2 binary
      combination and a blend of all three synthetic compounds plus prickly pear.
      Potential uses for the cactus weevil pheromone and possible ways to increase trap
      captures are discussed.

TI  - Seed anatomy and water uptake in relation to seed dormancy in Opuntia tomentosa
      (Cactaceae, Opuntioideae).
PG  - 581-92
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is considerable confusion in the literature concerning
      impermeability of seeds with 'hard' seed coats, because the ability to take up
      (imbibe) water has not been tested in most of them. Seeds of Opuntia tomentosa
      were reported recently to have a water-impermeable seed coat sensu lato (i.e.
      physical dormancy), in combination with physiological dormancy. However, physical
      dormancy is not known to occur in Cactaceae. Therefore, the aim of this study was
      to determine if seeds of O. tomentosa are water-permeable or water-impermeable,
      i.e. if they have physical dormancy. METHODS: The micromorphology of the seed
      coat and associated structures were characterized by SEM and light microscopy.
      Permeability of the seed-covering layers was assessed by an increase in mass of
      seeds on a wet substrate and by dye-tracking and uptake of tritiated water by
      intact versus scarified seeds. KEY RESULTS: A germination valve and a water
      channel are formed in the hilum-micropyle region during dehydration and ageing in
      seeds of O. tomentosa. The funicular envelope undoubtedly plays a role in
      germination of Opuntia seeds via restriction of water uptake and mechanical
      resistance to expansion of the embryo. However, seeds do not exhibit any of three
      features characteristic of those with physical dormancy. Thus, they do not have a
      water-impermeable layer(s) of palisade cells (macrosclereids) or a water gap
      sensu stricto and they imbibe water without the seed coat being disrupted.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although dormancy in seeds of this species can be broken by
      scarification, they have physiological dormancy only. Further, based on
      information in the literature, it is concluded that it is unlikely that any
      species of Opuntia has physical dormancy. This is the first integrative study of 
      the anatomy, dynamics of water uptake and dormancy in seeds of Cactaceae
      subfamily Opuntioideae.

TI  - Amino acid composition and betaxanthin formation in fruits from Opuntia
      ficus-indica.
PG  - 632-5
AB  - In contrast to earlier reports high levels of taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic
      acid) were found in fruit juices of three cultivars of Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) 
      Mill. Whereas the occurrence of taurine in plant tissue was thought to be
      restricted to algae, fungi, and the endosperm of some higher plants, prickly pear
      proved to be a rich source of dietary taurine. Using L-taurine as the amino
      compound, a new betaxanthin was synthesized by partial synthesis. On the basis of
      chemical and spectral evidence its structure was determined to be the
      taurine-immonium-conjugate of betalamic acid. Also betalamic acid could be
      detected in yellow and orange coloured cultivars of Opuntia ficus-indica for the 
      first time. In spite of the high levels of L-taurine accompanied by the
      occurrence of betalamic acid, the corresponding betaxanthin could not be detected
      in the fruit tissue.

TI  - Opuntia ficus indica (L.) Mill. mucilages show cytoprotective effect on gastric
      mucosa in rat.
PG  - 344-6
AB  - Opuntia ficus indica cladodes possess a protective action against ethanol-induced
      ulcer in the rat. The major components of cladodes are carbohydrate polymers,
      mainly mucilages and pectin. To clarify the cytoprotective effects of cladodes on
      experimental ethanol-induced ulcer in rat, mucilages and pectin were extracted
      and were administered instead of cladodes. The above mentioned effects induced by
      cladodes may be attributed to mucilages, and not significantly to pectin.

TI  - Effect of hyaluronic acid and polysaccharides from Opuntia ficus indica (L.)
      cladodes on the metabolism of human chondrocyte cultures.
PG  - 315-21
AB  - Conventional medications in articular disease are often effective for symptom
      relief, but they can also cause significant side effects and do not slow the
      progression of the disease. Several natural substances have been shown to be
      effective as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at relieving the symptoms of
      osteoarthritis (OA), and preliminary evidence suggests that some of these
      compounds may exert a favourable influence on the course of the disease. In this 
      study, we assay the anti-inflammatory/chondroprotective effect of some
      lyophilised extracts obtained from Opuntia ficus indica (L.) cladodes and of
      hyaluronic acid (HA) on the production of key molecules released during chronic
      inflammatory events such as nitric oxide (NO), glycosaminoglycans (GAGs),
      prostaglandins (PGE(2)) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human chondrocyte
      culture, stimulated with proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta).
      Further the antioxidant effect of these extracts was evaluated in vitro employing
      the bleaching of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH test).
      All the extracts tested in this study showed an interesting profile in active
      compounds. Particularly some of these extracts were characterized by polyphenolic
      and polysaccharidic species. In vitro results pointed out that the extracts of
      Opuntia ficus indica cladodes were able to contrast the harmful effects of IL-1
      beta. Our data showed the protective effect of the extracts of Opuntia ficus
      indica cladodes in cartilage alteration, which appears greater than that elicited
      by hyaluronic acid (HA) commonly employed as visco-supplementation in the
      treatment of joint diseases.

TI  - A combined electrocoagulation-sorption process applied to mixed industrial
      wastewater.
PG  - 240-8
AB  - The removal of organic pollutants from a highly complex industrial wastewater by 
      a aluminium electrocoagulation process coupled with biosorption was evaluated.
      Under optimal conditions of pH 8 and 45.45 Am(-2) current density, the
      electrochemical method yields a very effective reduction of all organic
      pollutants, this reduction was enhanced when the biosorption treatment was
      applied as a polishing step. Treatment reduced chemical oxygen demand (COD) by
      84%, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD(5)) by 78%, color by 97%, turbidity by 98%
      and fecal coliforms by 99%. The chemical species formed in aqueous solution were 
      determined. The initial and final pollutant levels in the wastewater were
      monitored using UV-vis spectrometry and cyclic voltammetry. Finally, the
      morphology and elemental composition of the biosorbent was characterized with
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersion spectra (EDS).

TI  - Plant reproductive allocation predicts herbivore dynamics across spatial and
      temporal scales.
PG  - 608-16
AB  - Life-history theory suggests that iteroparous plants should be flexible in their 
      allocation of resources toward growth and reproduction. Such plasticity could
      have consequences for herbivores that prefer or specialize on vegetative versus
      reproductive structures. To test this prediction, we studied the response of the 
      cactus bug (Narnia pallidicornis) to meristem allocation by tree cholla cactus
      (Opuntia imbricata). We evaluated the explanatory power of demographic models
      that incorporated variation in cactus relative reproductive effort (RRE; the
      proportion of meristems allocated toward reproduction). Field data provided
      strong support for a single model that defined herbivore fecundity as a
      time-varying, increasing function of host RRE. High-RRE plants were predicted to 
      support larger insect populations, and this effect was strongest late in the
      season. Independent field data provided strong support for these qualitative
      predictions and suggested that plant allocation effects extend across temporal
      and spatial scales. Specifically, late-season insect abundance was positively
      associated with interannual changes in cactus RRE over 3 years. Spatial variation
      in insect abundance was correlated with variation in RRE among five cactus
      populations across New Mexico. We conclude that plant allocation can be a
      critical component of resource quality for insect herbivores and, thus, an
      important mechanism underlying variation in herbivore abundance across time and
      space.

TI  - Fecal impaction in adults: report of 30 cases of seed bezoars in the rectum.
PG  - 1768-71
AB  - PURPOSE: Seed bezoars in the rectum have been considered an uncommon cause of
      fecal impaction in adults. Although there have been several reports on sunflower 
      seed bezoars, seed bezoars from the fruit of the prickly pear cactus and
      watermelon have received little notice. This study was designed to determine the 
      frequency of fecal impaction by seed bezoars in the rectum and their clinical
      characteristics in adults. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records
      of patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of fecal impaction during a ten-year 
      period. RESULTS: During the study period (January 1996 to December 2005), 55
      patients were hospitalized at the Western Galilee Hospital, in northern Israel,
      with the diagnosis of fecal impaction. Phytobezoars were found in 30 patients (55
      percent). The seed bezoars were composed of prickly pear seeds in 12 patients,
      watermelon seeds in 10 patients, sunflower seeds in 4 patients, popcorn kernels
      in 1 patient, and pomegranate seeds in 1 patient. The Jew:Arab ratio for seed
      bezoars was 7:23. Seventy-three patients had seedless fecal masses with a
      Jew:Arab ratio of 58:15. All 30 patients with bezoar underwent digital
      disimpaction under general anesthesia. Only 21 of 73 patients with seedless fecal
      masses were treated under general anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Seed bezoars found in 
      the rectum were the most common cause of fecal impaction requiring
      hospitalization, probably to the result of the eating habits in the Middle East. 
      The consumption of seeds with shell fragments or fruits containing many seeds
      (such as the prickly pear) should be accompanied by the awareness that large
      quantities may cause fecal impaction.

      (Opuntia spp.).
PG  - 115-9
AB  - Physico-chemical and nutritional composition from four different nopalitos (young
      cladodes from cacti): Blanco sin Espinas, Blanco con Espinas, Verde Valtierrilla 
      (cultivated materials) and a wild material from the central region of Mexico were
      studied at different sizes of harvesting. The first three are commercial crops.
      None of the tested materials exhibited superior characteristics in all of the
      evaluated parameters in relation to each one of them. In various cases properties
      of the wild crop were comparable, if not superior, to commercial ones. Some
      important changes were observed in total soluble solids, water content, texture, 
      acidity and pH as affected by size of cladode and specific crop. Most cladode
      samples appear to be a good source of beta-carotene and lutein. The presence of
      these compounds is important for human nutraceutical purposes.

TI  - Interactions between environment, species traits, and human uses describe
      patterns of plant invasions.
PG  - 1755-69
AB  - Although invasive alien species (IAS) are a major threat to biodiversity, human
      health, and economy, our understanding of the factors controlling their
      distribution and abundance is limited. Here, we determine how environmental
      factors, land use, life-history traits of the invaders, residence time, origin,
      and human usage interact to shape the spatial pattern of invasive alien plant
      species in South Africa. Relationships between the environmental factors and the 
      extrinsic and intrinsic attributes of species were investigated using RLQ
      analysis, a multivariate method for relating a species-attribute table to an
      environmental table by way of a species presence/absence table. We then clustered
      species according to their position on the RLQ axes, and tested these groups for 
      phylogenetic independence. The first three axes of the RLQ explained 99% of the
      variation and were strongly related to the species attributes. The clustering
      showed that, after accounting for environmental factors, the spatial pattern of
      IAS in South Africa was driven by human uses, life forms, and reproductive
      traits. The seven clusters of species strongly reflected geographical
      distribution, but also intrinsic species attributes and patterns of human use.
      Two of the clusters, centered on the genera Acacia and Opuntia, were
      phylogenetically non-independent. The remaining clusters comprised species of
      diverse taxonomic affinities, but sharing traits facilitating invasion in
      particular habitats. This information is useful for assessing the extent to which
      the potential spread of recent introductions can be predicted by considering the 
      interaction of their biological attributes, region of origin, and human use.

TI  - Effect of different fermentation conditions on the kinetic parameters and

      distilled beverage.
PG  - 921-8
AB  - An experimental design considering thermal treatment of must, yeast strain,
      prickly pear variety and degree of ripeness was chosen to evaluate the
      fermentation behavior and generation of volatile compounds, during the
      elaboration of a distilled beverage from prickly pear. Four Mexican prickly pear 
      varieties were characterized physically and two of them were selected for
      fermentation studies. The thermal treatment of the must showed the highest
      statistical influence on fermentation behavior and production of volatile
      compounds, followed by prickly pear variety, then yeast strain and finally the
      degree of ripeness was the least statistically significant factor. The growth
      rate increased when the thermal treatment was applied whereas the ethanol
      production rate and alcoholic efficiency were unaffected. The results also
      suggested that thermal treatment was effective for inhibition of microbial
      contamination. As regards volatile compounds production, acetic acid and methanol
      decreased while other volatiles increased when the thermal treatment was applied.
      Despite the influence of thermal treatment, prickly pear variety strongly
      influences the volatile profile of fermented musts.

      day) after it was induced by ethanol. Lipid composition, activity of
      5'-nucleotidase (a membrane-associated ectoenzyme) and cytosolic activities of
      lactate and alcohol dehydrogenases in the plasma membrane of gastric mucosa were 
      determined. Histological studies of gastric samples from the experimental groups 
      were included. RESULTS: Ethanol elicited the histological profile of gastritis
      characterized by loss of the surface epithelium and infiltration of
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) decreased and cholesterol 
      content increased in plasma membranes of the gastric mucosa. In addition,
      cytosolic activity increased while the activity of alcohol dehydrogenases
      decreased. The administration of mucilage promptly corrected these enzymatic
      changes. In fact, mucilage readily accelerated restoration of the ethanol-induced
      histological alterations and the disturbances in plasma membranes of gastric
      mucosa, showing a univocal anti-inflammatory effect. The activity of
      5'-nucleotidase correlated with the changes in lipid composition and the fluidity
      of gastric mucosal plasma membranes. CONCLUSION: The beneficial action of
      mucilage seems correlated with stabilization of plasma membranes of damaged
      gastric mucosa. Molecular interactions between mucilage monosaccharides and
      membrane phospholipids, mainly PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), may be the
      relevant features responsible for changing activities of membrane-attached
      proteins during the healing process after chronic gastric mucosal damage.

TI  - Glycoprotein (90 kDa) isolated from Opuntia ficus-indica var. saboten MAKINO
      lowers plasma lipid level through scavenging of intracellular radicals in Triton 
      WR-1339-induced mice.
PG  - 1391-6
AB  - The Opuntia ficus-indica var. saboten MAKINO (OFI) has been traditionally used as
      health food and herbal agent in folk medicine in Korea. In this study, we
      investigated whether the OFI glycoprotein has antioxidative activity and
      hypolipidemic effect on Triton WR-1339-induced A/J mice. The OFI glycoprotein
      inhibits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by
      glucose/glucose oxidase (G/GO) in BNL CL.2 cells. With its antioxidative
      property, the mice were orally administered in the OFI glycoprotein [50 mg/kg
      body weight (BW)] for two weeks. Our finding resulted in a significant decrease
      of plasma lipid levels in Triton WR-1339-treated mice such as total cholesterol
      (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Indeed, mice which
      induced by Triton WR-1339 were significantly increased the levels of TC, TG and
      LDL, whereas the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level obviously decreased.
      However, the values were reversed at pretreatment with OFI glycoprotein in Triton
      WR-1339-treated mice. The data also showed that pretreatment with OFI
      glycoprotein resulted in decrease of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances
      (TBARS) level and in increase of nitric oxide (NO) amount in presence of Triton
      WR-1339-treated mice, while the activities of antioxidant enzyme [superoxide
      dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)] were augmented.
      Therefore, we speculate that the OFI glycoprotein would be effective in lowering 
      of plasma lipid levels.

TI  - Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase expression in activated microglia and
      peroxynitrite scavenging activity by Opuntia ficus indica var. saboten.
PG  - 742-7
AB  - Activated microglia by neuronal injury or inflammatory stimulation overproduce
      nitric oxide (NO) by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) such as superoxide anion, resulting in neurodegenerative diseases. 
      The toxic peroxynitrite (ONOO-), the reaction product of NO and superoxide anion 
      further contributes to oxidative neurotoxicity. A butanol fraction obtained from 
      50% ethanol extracts of Opuntia ficus indica var. saboten (Cactaceae) stem (SK
      OFB901) and its hydrolysis product (SK OFB901H) inhibited the production of NO in
      LPS-activated microglia in a dose dependent manner (IC50 15.9, 4.2 microg/mL,
      respectively). They also suppressed the expression of protein and mRNA of iNOS in
      LPS-activated microglial cells at higher than 30 microg/mL as observed by western
      blot analysis and RT-PCR experiment. They also inhibited the degradation of
      I-kappaB-alpha in activated microglia. Moreover, they showed strong activity of
      peroxynitrite scavenging in a cell free bioassay system. These results imply that
      Opuntia ficus indica may have neuroprotective activity through the inhibition of 
      NO production by activated microglial cells and peroxynitrite scavenging
      activity.

TI  - Determination of the appetite suppressant P57 in Hoodia gordonii plant extracts
      and dietary supplements by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass
      spectrometry (LC-MSD-TOF) and LC-UV methods.
PG  - 606-11
AB  - Hoodia gordonii is traditionally used in South Africa for its appetite
      suppressant properties. P57AS3 (P57), an oxypregnane steroidal glycoside, is the 
      only reported active constituent from this plant as an appetite suppressant.
      Effective quality control of these extracts or products requires rapid methods to
      determine P57 content. New methods of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
      (LC/MS) and LC-UV for analysis of P57 from H. gordonii have been developed. The
      quantitative determination of P57 was achieved with a Phenomenex Gemini
      (Torrance, CA) reversed-phase column using gradient mobile phase of water and
      acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% acetic acid. The method was validated for
      linearity, repeatability, and limits of detection and quantification. Good
      results were obtained in terms of repeatability (relative standard deviation
      <5.0%) and recovery (98.5-103.5%). The developed methods were applied to the
      determination of P57 for H. gordonii plant samples, one related genus (Opuntia
      ficus-indica), and dietary supplements that claim to contain H. gordonii.

TI  - Patterns of variation in wing morphology in the cactophilic Drosophila buzzatii
      and its sibling D. koepferae.
PG  - 1275-82
AB  - Drosophila buzzatii and D. koepferae are two sibling species that breed on the
      necrotic tissues of several cactus species and show a certain degree of niche
      overlap. Also, they show differences in several life history traits, such as body
      size and developmental time, which probably evolved as a consequence of
      adaptation to different host plants. In this work we investigate the ecological
      and genetic factors affecting wing morphology variation both within and between
      species. Three wing traits were scored, distal and proximal wing length and width
      in isofemale lines reared in two of the most important host cacti: Opuntia
      sulphurea and Trichocereus terschekii. Our results revealed that differences
      between species and sexes in wing size and shape were significant, whereas the
      cactus factor was only significant for wing size. Intraspecific analyses showed
      that differences among isofemale lines were highly significant for both size and 
      shape in both species, suggesting that an important fraction of variation in wing
      morphology has a genetic basis. Moreover, the line by cactus interaction, which
      can be interpreted as a genotype by environment interaction, also accounted for a
      significant proportion of variation. In summary, our study shows that wing size
      is phenotypically plastic and that populations of D. buzzatii and D. koepferae
      harbour substantial amounts of genetic variation for wing size and shape.
      Interspecific differences in wing size and shape are interpreted in terms of
      spatial predictability of the different host plants in nature.

TI  - Space invaders? A search for patterns underlying the coexistence of alien black
      rats and Galapagos rice rats.
PG  - 276-88
AB  - The introduction and spread of the black rat Rattus rattus is believed to have
      caused the worst decline of any vertebrate taxon in Galapagos. However, the
      "extinct" Santiago rice rat Nesoryzomys swarthi has recently been rediscovered in
      sympatry with R. rattus providing the first exception to this general pattern of 
      displacement. We carried out an exploratory investigation of this novel system
      with the aim of identifying patterns that may facilitate the apparent coexistence
      of the two species. We carried out an extensive survey of Santiago Island to map 
      the current distribution of the endemic rice rat and to explore broad scale
      distribution-habitat associations. We then used live-trapping, radio-tracking,
      and spool-and-line tracking to quantify abundance-habitat correlations and to
      test for evidence of interspecific spatial segregation, alteration of N. swarthi 
      activity patterns (spatial and temporal), and microhabitat partitioning. We found
      that N. swarthi has disappeared from part of its historical range and appears to 
      be restricted to a 14 km stretch of the north-central coast, characterised by
      high density of the cactus Opuntia galapageia. In contrast, the generalist R.
      rattus was found at all survey sites. We found no evidence of spatial
      segregation, and home range size, temporal activity and density of N. swarthi did
      not vary with local density of R. rattus. However, pre-dawn and post-dusk N.
      swarthi activity levels increased with R. rattus density perhaps reflecting an
      increase in foraging effort necessary to compensate for the costs of
      interspecific exploitation or interference competition. The distribution,
      microhabitat selection, and abundance-habitat relations of N. swarthi suggest
      that the endemic cactus O. galapageia may facilitate interspecific coexistence.
      Further research should include a comparison of inter-seasonal resource
      preference and foraging activity of the two species coupled with replicated field
      experiments to confirm and quantify competition and to elucidate the mechanism of
      competitive coexistence.

TI  - Determination of free amino compounds in betalainic fruits and vegetables by gas 
      chromatography with flame ionization and mass spectrometric detection.
PG  - 4311-8
AB  - Amino acids and amines are the precursors of betalains. Therefore, the profiles
      of free amino compounds in juices obtained from cactus pears [Opuntia
      ficus-indica (L.) Mill. cv. Bianca, cv. Gialla, and cv. Rossa], pitaya fruits
      [Selenicereus megalanthus (K. Schumann ex Vaupel) Moran, Hylocereus polyrhizus
      (Weber) Britton & Rose, and Hylocereus undatus (Haworth) Britton & Rose], and in 
      extracts from differently colored Swiss chard [Beta vulgaris L. ssp. cicla (L.)
      Alef. cv. Bright Lights] petioles and red and yellow beets (B. vulgaris L. ssp.
      vulgaris var. conditiva Alef. cv. Burpee's Golden) were investigated for the
      first time. Amino compounds were derivatized with propyl chloroformate. While gas
      chromatography (GC) with mass spectrometry was used for peak assignment, GC flame
      ionization detection was applied for quantification of individual compounds.
      Whereas proline was the major free amino compound of cactus pear and pitaya fruit
      juices, glutamine dominated in Swiss chard stems and beets, respectively.
      Interestingly, extremely high concentrations of dopamine were detected in Swiss
      chard stems and beets. Furthermore, the cleavage of betaxanthins caused by
      derivatization in alkaline reaction solutions is demonstrated for the first time.
      Amino acids and amines thus released might increase the actual free amino
      compound contents of the respective sample. To evaluate the contribution of
      betaxanthin cleavage to total amino acid and amine concentration, isolated
      betaxanthins were derivatized according to the "EZ:faast" method prior to
      quantification of the respective amino compounds released. On a molar basis,
      betaxanthin contribution to overall amino compound contents was always below
      6.4%.

TI  - The effect of spineless cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica f. inermis) supplementation 
      on growth, carcass, meat quality and fatty acid composition of male goat kids.
PG  - 229-35
LID - 10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.11.018 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of grain compared to
      spineless cactus feeding on goat kids growth, carcass characteristics and FA
      profile. For this purpose, 21 kids were used and allocated to 3 groups receiving 
      a low quantity (200g) of oat hay. The control group received ad libitum a
      concentrate containing 130g crude protein (CP) per kg of dry matter (C130). The
      second group received half of that contained consumed by the control one but its 
      CP content was 260g/kg DM and spineless cactus ad libitum (C260-Cac). In the
      third group, concentrate intake was limited to soya bean at a quantity that
      provided the same CP quantity as the two other groups and also cached spineless
      cactus was distributed ad libitum (Soya-Cac). Animals of all groups had free
      access to water. At the end of the growth trial which lasted for 74 days, all
      kids were slaughtered. Samples of longissimus dorsi muscle were used for meat
      quality and FA composition study. Animals in the control group and those in the
      C260-Cac had higher growth rate than Soya-Cac diet animals. Muscle and adipose
      tissue mean weights were higher in the first groups while the bone weight was
      similar in all treatments. Animals given Soya-Cac diet had relatively less fat
      (10.5%) than those fed other diets (p<0.001). Carcass fat content tended to be
      lower (p=0.07) in C260-Cac goats (13.5%) than in those of the C130 group (15.8%).
      The ultimate pH ranged between 6.18 and 6.48; it was higher in meat from control 
      goats (C130) than in animals receiving cactus. Dietary treatment had no
      significant effect (p>0.05) on meat moisture, ash, crude fat and protein
      contents. The intra muscular lipid composition in fatty acids showed differences 
      between the control group and those receiving cactus. Cactus in the diet was
      associated with more C18:2 and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) as well as a higher
      proportion of PUFA and PUFA:SFA ratio than control ones. In conclusion, this
      study showed that cactus feeding of goat kids maximises the proportion of CLA,
      PUFA and PUFA:SFA ratio.

TI  - Nutritional and medicinal use of Cactus pear (Opuntia spp.) cladodes and fruits.
PG  - 2574-89
AB  - Natural products and health foods have recently received a lot of attention both 
      by health professionals and the common population for improving overall
      well-being, as well as in the prevention of diseases including cancer. In this
      line, all types of fruits and vegetables have been re-evaluated and recognized as
      valuable sources of nutraceuticals. The great number of potentially active
      nutrients and their multifunctional properties make cactus pear (Opuntia spp.)
      fruits and cladodes perfect candidates for the production of health-promoting
      food and food supplements. Although traditionally appreciated for its
      pharmacological properties by the Native Americans, cactus pear is still hardly
      recognized because of insufficient scientific information. However, recent
      studies on Opuntia spp. have demonstrated cactus pear fruit and vegetative
      cladodes to be excellent candidates for the development of healthy food.
      Therefore, this review summarizes current knowledge on the chemical composition
      of Opuntia cacti with particular emphasis in its use as food and medicine.

TI  - Effect of polysaccharides from Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) cladodes on the healing 
      of dermal wounds in the rat.
PG  - 352-8
AB  - In traditional medicine extracts of polysaccharide-containing plants are widely
      employed for the treatment of skin and epithelium wounds and of mucous membrane
      irritation. The extracts of Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes are used in folk
      medicine for their antiulcer and wound-healing activities. The present study
      describes the wound-healing potential of two lyophilized polysaccharide extracts 
      obtained from O. ficus-indica (L.) cladodes applied on large full-thickness
      wounds in the rat. When topically applied for 6 days, polysaccharides with a
      molecular weight (MW)>10(4)Da from O. ficus-indica cladodes induce a beneficial
      effect on cutaneous repair in this experimental model; in particular the topical 
      application of O. ficus-indica extracts on skin lesions accelerates the
      reepithelization and remodelling phases, also by affecting cell-matrix
      interactions and by modulating laminin deposition. Furthermore, the wound-healing
      effect is more marked for polysaccharides with a MW ranging 10(4)-10(6)Da than
      for those with MW>10(6)Da, leading us to suppose that the fine structure of these
      polysaccharides and thus their particular hygroscopic, rheologic and viscoelastic
      properties may be essential for the wound-healing promoter activity observed.

TI  - Postharvest heat and cold treatment to control Ceratitis capitata on cactus pear 
      fruit.
PG  - 733-6
AB  - In order to work out a quarantine treatment for cactus pear fruit a factorial
      experimental plan was carried combining postharvest water dips at 20, 50, 54, 58 
      and 60 degrees C and storage at 1 degrees C for 3, 6 and 10 days. Cactus pear
      fruit cv 'Rossa' were artificially infested with Med. fly eggs (at least 20 eggs 
      per fruit) then left in the lab at 25 degrees C for 4 days. Treatments took place
      by dipping the fruit at each water temperature for 2 mm. At each established time
      fruit was picked and checked for vital larvae and degree of chilling injury (CI).
      Probit 9 requirements were achieved in all cases when fruit was cold-stored for
      10 days. When fruit was kept for 6 days the quarantine requirement was achieved
      only by dipping the fruit at 58 and 60 degrees C while none dip treatment was
      effective if fruit was stored for 3 days at 1 degrees C. All Fruit stored for 10 
      days at 1 degrees C showed severe CI symptoms and when kept for 6 days the same
      degree of CI was found on fruit dipped in water at 20, 58 and 60 degrees C. No CI
      was observed after 3 days at 1 degrees C. In conclusion only when fruit was
      dipped at 50-54 degrees C and stored for 10 days at 1 degrees C the probit 9
      condition was attained with acceptable CI symptoms.

TI  - Aborted fruits of Opuntia microdasys (Cactaceae): insurance against reproductive 
      failure.
PG  - 505-11
LID - 10.3732/ajb.93.4.505 [doi]
AB  - New individuals in clonal populations arise through the recruitment of sexual or 
      clonal offspring. The predominance of one type of regeneration over the other has
      been correlated with different selective environmental pressures. We compared the
      reproductive mode (sexual through seeds and vegetative through plantlets or
      detached cladodes) of Opuntia microdasys from three desert habitats of the
      Chihuahuan Desert: bajada (BH), hill-piedmont (HPH), and an interdune (IDH).
      Successful establishment and growth of plantlets were determined in two
      experiments: (1) the effect of light (three levels of photosynthetically active
      radiation [PAR]: full, low, and medium) and two levels of watering and (2)
      maternal effects and provenance of plantlets. Adult plant densities did not
      differ among habitats (639 individuals/ha), but the number of offspring and fruit
      production increased significantly at BH. Plantlets (94.3%) dominated the form of
      recruitment for all habitats, followed by cladodes (3.1%) and seedlings (2.6%). A
      higher proportion of plantlets established in the low and medium PAR treatments
      (76%) in comparison to full exposure (39%). Maternal factors affected survival
      and growth, but plantlet provenance did not. The high fruit abortion rate
      resulting from environmental and maternal effects provided suitable conditions
      for establishment of plantlets.

TI  - Removal of chromium and toxic ions present in mine drainage by Ectodermis of
      Opuntia.
PG  - 846-53
AB  - This work presents conditions for hexavalent and trivalent chromium removal from 
      aqueous solutions using natural, protonated and thermally treated Ectodermis of
      Opuntia. A removal of 77% of Cr(VI) and 99% of Cr(III) can be achieved. The
      sorbent material is characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy
      dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,
      before and after the contact with the chromium containing aqueous media. The
      results obtained from the characterization techniques indicate that the metal ion
      remains on the surface of the sorbent material. The percentage removal is found
      to depend on the initial chromium concentration and pH. The Cr(VI) and Cr(III)
      uptake process is maximum at pH 4, using 0.1g of sorbent per liter of aqueous
      solution. The natural Ectodermis of Opuntia showed a chromium adsorption capacity
      that was adequately described by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Finally, an
      actual mine drainage sample that contained Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe Zn, Ni and Pb was
      tested under optimal conditions for chromium removal and Ectodermis of Opuntia
      was found to be a suitable sorbent material. The use of this waste material for
      the treatment of metal-containing aqueous solutions as well as mine drainage is
      effective and economical.

TI  - [Study on chemical constituents from Opuntia dillenii].
PG  - 1824-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the chemical composition of Opuntia dillenii. METHOD: Many
      kinds of chromatography methods were used in the isolation procedure, while the
      structures of isolated compounds were determined on the aids of NMR and MS
      spectral analysis. RESULT: A new compound, together with five known compounds,
      was isolated form the 80% ethanolic extract of its stems. CONCLUSION: The new
      compound was characterized as opuntioside. Four compounds were obtained for the
      first from the genus Opuntia, and they were daucosterol, p-hydroxybenzoicacid,
      L-(-)-malic acid, (E)-ferulic acid. Opuntiol was also separated for the first
      from the plant.

TI  - Biochemical and nutritional characterization of three prickly pear species with
      different ripening behavior.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - Biochemical and nutritional changes were studied during the ripening process of
      three Opuntia morphospecies with different ripening behavior: Naranjona (O.
      ficus-indica), Blanca Cristalina (Opuntia sp.), and Esmeralda (Opuntia sp.) of
      early, early-intermediate, and intermediate-late ripening, respectively. In loss 
      of fresh weight, Naranjona showed the highest values, while in Blanca Cristalina 
      and Esmeralda, a discrete weight loss was found. No significant differences were 
      found among morphospecies in soluble solids, total titratable acidity and pH
      during the postharvest days. Blanca Cristalina and Esmeralda showed an increase
      in the content of carotenoids, while these diminished in Naranjona. The cell wall
      enzymes evaluated showed particular behaviors during the ripening of each
      morphospecies suggesting a fine biochemical control and not a clear relationship 
      between fruit softening and enzyme activity. This study provides basic
      information on prickly pear ripening, in order to understand this process for its
      control and for improving shelf life.

TI  - Radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory activity of extracts from Opuntia
      humifusa Raf.
PG  - 113-9
AB  - Opuntia humifusa Raf. (O. humifusa Raf.) is a member of the Cactaceae family. To 
      determine the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of this herb, various
      solvent fractions (methanol, hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol, and
      water) prepared from the leaves of cacti were tested using DPPH
      (2,2-diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl radical) and xanthine oxidase assays, and nitric
      oxide (NO)-producing macrophage cells. We found that O. humifusa Raf. displayed
      potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, all solvent fractions,
      except for the water layer, showed potent scavenging effects. The scavenging
      effect of the ethyl acetate fraction was higher than that of the other fractions,
      with IC50 values of 3.6 and 48.2 microg mL(-1). According to activity-guided
      fractionation, one of the active radical scavenging principles in the ethyl
      acetate fraction was found to be quercetin. In contrast, only two fractions
      (chloroform and ethyl acetate) significantly suppressed nitric oxide production
      from the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW264.7 cells. In addition,
      chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions significantly blocked the expression of
      inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) from the
      RAW264.7 cells stimulated by LPS. Moreover, ethyl acetate fractions significantly
      blocked the expression of IL-1beta from the RAW264.7 cells stimulated by LPS.
      Therefore, the results suggested that O. humifusa Raf. may modulate
      radical-induced toxicity via both direct scavenging activity and the inhibition
      of reactive species generation, and the modulation of the expression of
      inflammatory cytokines. Finally, O. humifusa Raf. may be useful as a functional
      food or drug against reactive species-mediated disease.

TI  - Interventions for preventing or treating alcohol hangover: systematic review of
      randomised controlled trials.
PG  - 1515-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical evidence on the effectiveness of any medical
      intervention for preventing or treating alcohol hangover. DATA SOURCES:
      Systematic searches on Medline, Embase, Amed, Cochrane Central, the National
      Research Register (UK), and ClincalTrials.gov (USA); hand searches of conference 
      proceedings and bibliographies; contact with experts and manufacturers of
      commercial preparations. Language of publication was not restricted. STUDY
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All randomised controlled trials of any medical
      intervention for preventing or treating alcohol hangover were included. Trials
      were considered if they were placebo controlled or controlled against a
      comparator intervention. Titles and abstracts of identified articles were read
      and hard copies were obtained. The selection of studies, data extraction, and
      validation were done independently by two reviewers. The Jadad score was used to 
      evaluate methodological quality. RESULTS: Fifteen potentially relevant trials
      were identified. Seven publications failed to meet all inclusion criteria. Eight 
      randomised controlled trials assessing eight different interventions were
      reviewed. The agents tested were propranolol, tropisetron, tolfenamic acid,
      fructose or glucose, and the dietary supplements Borago officinalis (borage),
      Cynara scolymus (artichoke), Opuntia ficus-indica (prickly pear), and a yeast
      based preparation. All studies were double blind. Significant intergroup
      differences for overall symptom scores and individual symptoms were reported only
      for tolfenamic acid, gamma linolenic acid from B officinalis, and a yeast based
      preparation. CONCLUSION: No compelling evidence exists to suggest that any
      conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or
      treating alcohol hangover. The most effective way to avoid the symptoms of
      alcohol induced hangover is to practise abstinence or moderation.

TI  - Evaluation of some biological parameters of Opuntia ficus indica. 2. Influence of
      seed supplemented diet on rats.
PG  - 2136-40
AB  - The present research was undertaken to evaluate some biological parameters in
      rats fed with a supplemented diet with Opuntia ficus indica powder seeds. Feed
      intake and body weight of rats were measured every two days during nine weeks of 
      treatment. Digestibility, feed conversion efficiency and protein efficiency ratio
      were determined. No difference in digestibility was noticed between the different
      diets. The results indicated a significant decrease in body weight of rats
      receiving a diet partially substituted with O. ficus indica powder seeds,
      probably due to a significant decrease in serum-free thyroxin (FT(4)) compared to
      the control group. In the treated group, a decrease of glucose concentration in
      blood and an increase of glycogen in liver and skeletal muscle were noticed. A
      significant increase in HDL-cholesterol was noted in the group receiving the
      supplemented diet with O. ficus indica powder seeds. These results suggest that
      O. ficus indica seeds can be used as a healthy food.

TI  - Opuntia ficus-indica attenuates neuronal injury in in vitro and in vivo models of
      cerebral ischemia.
PG  - 257-62
AB  - We examined whether the methanol extract of Opuntia ficus-indica (MEOF) has a
      neuroprotective action against N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-, kainate (KA)-, and
      oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neuronal injury in cultured mouse
      cortical cells. We also evaluated the protective effect of MEOF in the
      hippocampal CA1 region against neuronal damage evoked by global ischemia in
      gerbils. Treatment of neuronal cultures with MEOF (30, 300, and 1000 microg/ml)
      inhibited NMDA (25 microM)-, KA (30 microM)-, and OGD (50 min)-induced
      neurotoxicity dose-dependently. The butanol fraction of Opuntia ficus-indica (300
      microg/ml) significantly reduced NMDA (20 microM)-induced delayed neurotoxicity
      by 27%. Gerbils were treated with MEOF every 24h for 3 days (0.1, 1.0, and 4.0
      g/kg, p.o.) or for 4 weeks (0.1 and 1.0 g/kg, p.o.), and ischemic injury was
      induced after the last dose. Neuronal cell damage in the hippocampal CA1 region
      was evaluated quantitatively at 5 days after the ischemic injury. When gerbils
      were given doses of 4.0 g/kg (3 days) and 1.0 g/kg (4 weeks), the neuronal damage
      in the hippocampal region was reduced by 32 and 36%, respectively. These results 
      suggest that the preventive administration of Opuntia ficus-indica extracts may
      be helpful in alleviating the excitotoxic neuronal damage induced by global
      ischemia.

TI  - The anticancer activity of the fungal metabolite terrecyclic acid A is associated
      with modulation of multiple cellular stress response pathways.
PG  - 1569-76
AB  - Tumors are dependent on cellular stress responses, in particular the heat shock
      response, for survival in their hypoxic, acidotic, and nutrient-deprived
      microenvironments. Using cell-based reporter assays, we have identified
      terrecyclic acid A (TCA) from Aspergillus terreus, a fungus inhabiting the
      rhizosphere of Opuntia versicolor of the Sonoran desert, as a small-molecule
      inducer of the heat shock response that shows anticancer activity. Further
      characterization suggested that TCA also affects oxidative and inflammatory
      cellular stress response pathways. The presence of an alpha-methylene ketone
      moiety suggested that TCA may form adducts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins.
      Reaction with labile intracellular cysteines was supported by our finding that
      the glutathione precursor N-acetyl-cysteine protected tumor cells from the
      cytotoxic effects of TCA whereas the glutathione-depleting agent buthionine
      sulfoximine enhanced its activity. Related sesquiterpenes have been shown to
      increase levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to inhibit nuclear factor
      kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcriptional activity. To assess whether TCA could have
      similar activities, we used a ROS-sensitive dye and flow cytometry to show that
      TCA does indeed increase ROS levels in 3LL cells. When tested in cells carrying
      NF-kappaB reporter constructs, TCA also exhibited concentration-dependent
      inhibition of cytokine-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. These findings
      suggest that TCA modulates multiple stress pathways-the oxidative, heat shock,
      and inflammatory responses-in tumor cells that promote their survival.
      Small-molecule natural products such as TCA may serve as useful probes for
      understanding the relationships between these pathways, potentially providing
      leads for the design of novel and effective anticancer drugs.

TI  - Morphological and secretory characterization of extrafloral nectaries in plants
      of coastal Veracruz, Mexico.
PG  - 1175-89
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Morphological descriptions of the extrafloral nectaries
      (EFNs) of certain plant species are common in the literature, but they rarely
      relate morphology with histology, gland distribution and secretory attributes. In
      this study a morphological/secretory characterization of EFNs occurring on
      several plant species in a tropical coastal community is made and the
      implications of gland attributes discussed from a functional perspective.
      METHODS: The morphology and nectar secretion of the EFNs of 20 plant species are 
      characterized through scanning electron microscopy, histochemical detection of
      reducing sugars (Fehling's reagent) and nectar volume/concentration estimates.
      KEY RESULTS: Sixty-five per cent of plant species in coastal communities had EFNs
      on vegetative structures and 35 % of species had glands on reproductive and
      vegetative organs. The Fabaceae is the plant family with the most species with
      EFNs and most diversity of gland morphologies. Four types of vascularized
      nectaries and four of glandular trichomes are described; sugar-secreting
      trichomes are characterized using Fehling's technique, and the first descriptions
      of unicellular and peltate trichomes functioning as EFNs are provided. Glands of 
      ten plant species and six genera are described for the first time. Four plant
      species possess more than one morphological type of EFN. Eleven species have EFNs
      in more than one location or organ. More complex glands secrete more nectar, but 
      are functionally homologous to the aggregations of numerous secretory trichomes
      on specific and valuable plant organs. CONCLUSION: Important diversity of EFN
      morphology was foundin the coastal plant community studied. Both vascularized and
      non-vascularized EFNs are observed in plants and, for the latter, previously
      non-existent morpho-secretory characterizations are provided with a
      methodological approach to study them. It is recommended that studies relating
      EFN attributes (i.e. morphology, distribution) with their differential visitation
      by insects (i.e. ants) and the cost of maintenance to the plants are carried out 
      to understand the evolution of these glands.

TI  - Antiinflammatory flavonoids from Opuntia dillenii (Ker-Gawl) Haw. flowers growing
      in Egypt.
PG  - 807-9
AB  - Opuntia dillenii (Ker-Gawl) Haw. (Family Cactaceae), is used in folk medicine as 
      an antidiabetic and antiinflammatory. The antiinflammatory activity of the
      alcohol extracts of the flowers, fruits and stems was carried out using the
      carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema model. The analgesic effect of the same
      extracts was evaluated using electric current as a noxious stimulus. The alcohol 
      extract of the flowers revealed the most potent antiinflammatory effect and a
      pronounced analgesic action at a dose of 200 mg/kg. Bioassay-guided fractionation
      of this extract using VLC followed by Sephadex and paper chromatography, afforded
      three flavonoid glycosides, namely, kaempferol 3-O-alpha-arabinoside,
      isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside. Their identification 
      was based on physical, chemical and spectroscopic data.

TI  - Opuntia ficus indica (L.) Mill. fruit juice protects liver from carbon
      tetrachloride-induced injury.
PG  - 796-800
AB  - The protective effects of the juice of Opuntia ficus indica fruit (prickly pear) 
      against carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced hepatotoxicity were examined in
      rats. The animals were treated orally with the juice (3 mL/rat) 2 h after
      administration of the hepatotoxic agent. Preventive effects were studied by
      giving the juice (3 mL/rat) for 9 consecutive days. On day 9 the rats received
      the hepatotoxic agent. Morphological and biochemical evaluations were carried out
      24, 48 and 72 h after induction of the hepatic damage. Data show that O. ficus
      indica fruit juice administration exerts protective and curative effects against 
      the CCl(4)-induced degenerative process in rat liver. Histology evaluation
      revealed a normal hepatic parenchyma at 48 h; the injury was fully restored after
      72 h. Moreover, a significant reduction in CCl(4)-induced increase of GOT and GPT
      plasma levels is evident; these data are in agreement with the functional
      improvement of hepatocytes. O. ficus indica fruit juice contains many phenol
      compounds, ascorbic acid, betalains, betacyanins, and a flavonoid fraction, which
      consists mainly of rutin and isorhamnetin derivatives. Hepatoprotection may be
      related to the flavonoid fraction of the juice, but other compounds, such as
      vitamin C and betalains could, synergistically, counteract many degenerative
      processes by means of their antioxidant activity.

      cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) fruits and changes of bioactive juice
      components upon industrial processing.
PG  - 7851-5
AB  - Biothiols, taurine, and flavonols, as well as tocopherols and carotenoids have
      been assessed in the edible pulp of Sicilian red (Sanguigna), yellow (Surfarina),
      and white (Muscaredda) cultivars of cactus pear. The yellow cultivar has the
      highest level of reduced glutathione (GSH, 8.1 +/- 0.78 mg/100 g pulp), whereas
      the white cultivar showed the highest amount of cysteine (1.21 +/- 0.12 mg/100 g 
      pulp). Taurine accounted for 11.7 +/- 1.0 mg/100 g in the yellow pulp, while
      lower levels were measured in the others. With the exception of kaempferol in the
      yellow cultivar (2.7 +/- 0.2 microg/100 g pulp), the edible pulp of cactus pear
      was not a source of flavonols. Very low amounts of lipid-soluble antioxidant
      vitamins such as vitamin E and carotenoids were measured in all cultivars. As a
      consequence of industrial processing, a total loss of GSH and beta-carotene and a
      net decrease of vitamin C and cysteine were revealed in the fruit juice, whereas 
      betalains, taurine, and vitamin E appeared to be less susceptible to degradation.

TI  - Cactus mild mottle virus is a new cactus-infecting tobamovirus.
PG  - 13-21
AB  - A new cactus-infecting tobamovirus, Cactus mild mottle virus (CMMoV), was
      isolated from diseased grafted cactus, Gymnocalycium mihanovichii and its
      molecular properties were characterized. CMMoV is distantly related to known
      species of the genus Tobamovirus on the basis of serological and sequence
      analyses. Western blot analysis showed that CMMoV is serologically unrelated to
      Sammon's Opuntia virus, which is the only known species of the genus Tobamovirus 
      found in cactus plants. The 3'-terminal 2,910 nucleotides of CMMoV have been
      sequenced. The coat protein (CP) and movement protein (MP) genes encode 161 and
      306 amino acids residues, respectively, and the 3' untranslated region (UTR)
      consists of 229 nucleotides long. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the 
      CP of CMMoV were 39.6% to 49.2% and 25.8% to 40.3% identical to other seventeen
      tobamoviruses, respectively. The MP shared 34.9% to 40.6% and 16.3% to 27.0% and 
      44.6% to 63.4% identities, respectively, at the amino acid and nucleotide levels 
      with other members of the genus. Percentage identities of nucleotides of the 3'
      UTR ranged from 42.5% to 63.4%. Phylogenetic tree analyses of the CP and MP
      suggest the existence of the fifth cactus-infecting subgroup in the genus
      Tobamovirus. Sequence analyses of these two viral proteins revealed that the
      highest amino acid sequence identity between the virus and seventeen other
      tobamoviruses was 40.6%, supporting the view that CMMoV is a new definite species
      of the genus Tobamovirus.

TI  - Evaluation of some biological parameters of Opuntia ficus indica. 1. Influence of
      a seed oil supplemented diet on rats.
PG  - 1382-6
AB  - Cactus pear (Opuntia ficus indica) is native to Tunisia and the fruit is consumed
      exclusively as fresh fruit. The seed oil is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids
      but the nutritive value of the oil is unknown. The objective of our research was 
      to determine the fatty acid content of cactus pear seed oil and to evaluate the
      effect of an oil supplemented diet on rats. The main fatty acids of prickly pear 
      seed oil were C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2 with an exceptional level of linoleic
      acid, up to 700 g kg(-1), and a total content of unsaturated fatty acids of 884.8
      g kg(-1). Feed intake and body weight of rats were measured every two days during
      the nine weeks of treatment. Digestibility, feed conversion efficiency and
      protein efficiency ratio were determined. No difference in digestibility was
      noted for the oil enriched diet. The results indicated a significant decrease in 
      serum glucose concentration (22%) over the control group. However, an increase in
      the concentration of glycogen was noted in liver and muscle. Blood cholesterol
      and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol decreased in the treated group.
      High density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentration remained unaltered
      during the treatment. These findings support the nutritional value of cactus pear
      as a natural source of edible oil containing essential fatty acids and reinforce 
      the possibility of cactus pear as a new crop for Tunisia especially in semi-arid 
      regions, where conventional crops are difficult to establish.

TI  - Cd(II) and Pb(II) separation from aqueous solution using clinoptilolite and
      Opuntia ectodermis.
PG  - 821-9
AB  - This work presents the conditions for Pb(II) and Cd(II) removal from aqueous
      solution using two different sorbent materials, namely, clinoptilolite and
      Opuntia ectodermis, which were characterized before and after entering into
      contact with the metal-containing aqueous media, using scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM), thermal analysis (TGA) and surface area (BET). Metal removal
      was found to depend on the initial metal concentration in aqueous solution, pH
      and the mass/volume ratio. The Pb(II) and Cd(II) uptake process was maximum at pH
      4 for both sorbents, which showed an adsorption capacity that was adequately
      described by the Freundlich adsorption isotherm. The Thomas model was used to
      describe the adsorption data from column studies, the sorption capacity was 12.21
      Pb(II) mg per gram of Opuntia ectodermis, while 7.71 Pb(II) mg per gram of
      clinoptilolite were adsorbed; lower values were obtained for Cd(II) removal. It
      was demonstrated that the use of low cost materials for the treatment of Pb(II), 
      and Cd(II), containing wastewater is an effective and economical alternative
      method.

PG  - 694-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the regulative effect of opuntia powder on blood lipids in 
      wistar rats and to explore its mechanism. METHOD: Forty normal rats were divided 
      into four groups:control group (fed with basal feed), opuntia high, middle and
      low dosage groups (fed with basal feed and opuntia powder of high, middle and low
      dosage. The influence of opuntia powder on serum total cholesterol (TC),
      triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), arteriosclerosis index (AI), serum
      malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) were observed. (2) All of the
      hyperlipemia wistar rats for experiments were divided into four groups: model
      control group and other three groups (high, middle, low dosage groups
      respectively). Three weeks later, samples of blood were taken for survey of
      levels of TC, TG HDL-C, LDL-C, AI, MDA, SOD. RESULT: After opuntia powder
      treatment,the level of TC in nomal wistar rats was decreased. However, there was 
      no significant difference comparing with control group (P > 0.05). The serum MAD 
      level in the low, middle and high dosage groups were all obviously decreased,
      which were significantly lower than that in the control group. The SOD activities
      were all higher than that in the control group. The level of TC, LDL-C, AI (P <
      0.01), TG (P < 0.05) were lower significantly in hyperlipemia wistar rats after
      treated by opuntia powder of high, middle and low dosage. The down-regulation of 
      blood lipids was related with the dosage of opuntia powder. CONCLUSION: The
      opuntia powder may regulate the level of blood lipids in normal and hyperlipemia 
      wistar rats. The effect is more obviously in hyperlipemia rats than that in
      normal rats.

TI  - Does cladode inclination restrict microhabitat distribution for Opuntia puberula 
      (Cactaceae)?
PG  - 700-8
LID - 10.3732/ajb.92.4.700 [doi]
AB  - In contrast with other Opuntia species, most of the cladodes of Opuntia puberula 
      have a horizontal position. This study explores whether the horizontal cladodes
      are an adaptive trait to increase light interception in the understory or are a
      neutral trait, and if this characteristic may prevent its distribution in full
      sun habitats. Cladode inclination angle and its effect on light interception,
      cladode temperature, and carbon gain are characterized, and anatomical and
      physiological traits of upper and lower cladode surfaces are described.
      Inclination angle was under 50 degrees for 95% of the cladodes, and the frequency
      of low inclination angles increases as light availability decreases. Nocturnal
      acid accumulation increased with total daily PPFD intercepted, but no significant
      differences were detected between typical horizontal cladodes and the few
      vertical cladodes. Chlorophyll content differed in the upper and lower surfaces
      of horizontal cladodes; however, chlorenchyma thickness, stomatal conductance,
      and nocturnal acid accumulation were similar between surfaces. The horizontal
      position of O. puberula cladodes, which is anatomically determined, restricts it 
      to shaded habitats, where the plants do not overheat, but seems to have no effect
      on carbon gain.

TI  - Growth performance of lambs in Phangrang, Vietnam: effects of a dietary
      supplement containing prickly-pear cactus.
PG  - 237-44
AB  - In Phanrang, Vietnam, sheep production is limited by the sparse availability of
      green roughage. Although prickly-pear cactus (Opuntia elator) is abundant in the 
      area, it is not used. It was considered relevant therefore to test whether
      prickly-pear cactus could be used a component of feed supplements. With the use
      of the cactus and other local products--namely groundnut cake, fish sauce
      by-product, molasses, rice bran and cassava flour--two supplements were prepared.
      The level of cactus in the two supplements was 670 g/kg product (320 g/kg dry
      matter). The cactus was burned to remove the spines, chopped and sun-dried before
      use. The cactus preparation contained only 12 g crude protein/kg (68 g/ kg dry
      matter). The protein content of the two supplements was raised with either
      groundnut cake or fish sauce by-product. Sheep that were grazing during the day
      were offered either no supplement or one of the supplements when confined during 
      the night. During a period of 3 months, non-supplemented control sheep gained 98 
      +/- 10.5 g/day (mean +/- SD, n=10). Sheep supplemented with cactus and groundnut 
      gained 145 +/- 12.3 g/day, and those given cactus and fish sauce gained 130 +/-
      11.7 g/day. It is concluded that prickly-pear cactus has potential as component
      of feed supplements for sheep.

TI  - Cactus stems (Opuntia spp.): a review on their chemistry, technology, and uses.
PG  - 175-94
AB  - Although traditionally used as a valuable health supporting nutrient, the
      vegetative parts of Opuntia spp. plants are scarcely used in modern nutrition and
      medicine. While all kinds of different Opuntia spp. have been studied, a
      systematic approach regarding the inter-relationships between the composition and
      the pre- and postharvest conditions is still missing. Therefore, the present
      review compiles and discusses literature on the chemical composition of cactus
      stems, the knowledge on uses in food, medicine, and cosmetics. It is concluded
      that much research is needed to get an insight into the multitude of
      bioactivities reported in the traditional literature but also to take advantage
      of the respective constituents for food and pharmaceutical applications.

TI  - Evidence of formation of glushinskite as a biomineral in a Cactaceae species.
PG  - 611-4
AB  - The X-ray diffractometric and infrared spectroscopic investigation of crystalline
      material isolated from the Cactaceae species Opuntia ellisiana shows the presence
      of a very complex mineral composition, including whewellite (monohydrated calcium
      oxalate), opal (SiO2), calcite (CaCO3) and glushinskite (dihydrated magnesium
      oxalate). This is the first report of the presence of magnesium oxalate in
      plants.

TI  - Color, betalain pattern, and antioxidant properties of cactus pear (Opuntia spp.)
      clones.
PG  - 442-51
AB  - Total phenolics, ascorbic acid, and betalain contents of differently colored
      cactus pear clones (nine Opuntia ficus-indica [L.] Mill. clones and one O.
      robusta Wendl. clone) were investigated and related to their respective
      antioxidant potential assessed by Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC)
      and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays. TEAC and ORAC values were
      very highly correlated with each other and also with values for total phenolics, 
      betalain contents, and ascorbic acid concentrations. Total phenolics had the
      greatest contribution to ORAC and TEAC values. High-performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detector (DAD)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
      measurements of cactus pear juices permitted the differentiation of the clones
      based on variations in pigment patterns and betalain concentrations. The red and 
      yellow betalains were absent in lime green colored cactus fruits. The ratio and
      concentration of these pigments were responsible for the yellow, orange, red, and
      purple colors in the other clones. Progeny of purple and lime green colored
      parents were characterized by 12% and 88% of plants bearing lime green and purple
      fruit, respectively. This implies that the genes for betalain production were
      lacking in the lime green fruits but could be provided by a parent with a
      complete set of genes, that is, purple fruits. Besides known pigments typical of 
      Cactaceae, two unexpected betalains were identified. Whereas gomphrenin I was
      found for the first time in tissues of cactus plants, methionine-betaxanthin has 
      never been described before as a genuine betalain. In addition to their alleged
      health-promoting properties, various combinations of yellow betaxanthins and
      red-purple betacyanins may allow the development of new food products without
      using artificial colorants.
