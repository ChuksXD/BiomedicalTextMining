AB  - Apoptosis imaging enables a timely and specific assessment of treatment response 
      in cancer patients. In this study, we applied a probe for positron emission
      tomography (PET), which served as an optical biomaterial emitting Cerenkov
      photons, to in vivo optical imaging of tumor apoptosis, in order to evaluate
      early response to chemotherapy of drug-resistant gastric cancer.
      (68)Ga-DOTA-Annexin V was prepared as the apoptosis targeting probe. Wild type
      human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line SGC7901/WT and drug vincristine-resistant 
      variant SGC7901/VCR were used to establish normal and vincristine-resistant
      xenografts to simulate treatment decision situation. Vincristine-resistance of
      SGC7901/VCR and apoptosis-induction ability of vincristine and cisplatin were
      verified. In vitro and in vivo CLI of apoptosis was performed. Stronger signals
      of apoptosis of CLI correlated with confirmed higher levels of apoptosis and
      subsequent changes in tumor sizes. Our study suggests that CLI is a promising
      technique for in vivo imaging of apoptosis with radiopharmaceutical-labeled
      biomaterials.
