TI  - Safety and accuracy of (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT in children and young adults with
      solid tumors.
PG  - 228-235
AB  - (68)Ga-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide ((68)Ga-DOTATOC) PET/CT has been shown to have high
      accuracy in adults with neuroendocrine tumors, however has not been studied in
      pediatric patients. This study evaluated the safety and accuracy of
      (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT in children and young adults with solid tumors that express
      somatostatin receptor type 2. A series of three prospective, IRB approved,
      clinical trials evaluating safety and efficacy of (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT were
      conducted for subjects aged 6 months to 90 years. This study reports the results 
      for the 26 children and young adults, aged 16 months to 29 years who participated
      in these trials. The administered activity of (68)Ga-DOTATOC was 1.59 MBq/kg with
      an upper limit of 111 MBq for subjects < 18 years and 148 MBq for young adults.
      Safety was assessed with laboratory studies and patient/parent report of symptoms
      before and after the scan. Scans were interpreted in consensus by two
      board-certified nuclear medicine physicians. Each scan was categorized on a
      patient basis as true positive, true negative, false negative or false positive
      against a reference standard that included a combination of histopathology, other
      imaging modalities and clinical follow-up. Nine Grade I adverse events (AEs)
      occurred among 26 subjects, none of which were attributable to (68)Ga-DOTATOC.
      Sensitivity of (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT was 88% (14 true positive, 2 false negative)
      and specificity was 100% (10 true negative, 0 false positive). (68)Ga-DOTATOC
      PET/CT is safe and accurate in children and young adults with solid tumors
      expressing somatostatin receptor type 2.
