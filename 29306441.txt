AB  - Metabolic labeling of glycans with sugar chemical reporters (i.e., unnatural
      sugars bearing a bioorthogonal group), followed by bioorthogonal reaction with
      imaging probes or affinity tags, has enabled visualization and proteomic analysis
      of glycosylation in live cells and in living animals. This two-step metabolic
      glycan labeling strategy has emerged as a powerful tool for probing
      glycosylation, but suffers from a lack of cell-type selectivity. Here we describe
      liposome-assisted bioorthogonal reporter (LABOR), a liposome-assisted format of
      metabolic glycan labeling that allows for cell-selective and tissue-specific
      glycan imaging and glycoproteomic profiling. After a brief introduction of the
      principles and applications of LABOR, we provide detailed protocols for
      performing LABOR in cell culture and in living mice.
