AB  - Previous studies have shown that nylon flocked swabs outperform traditional fiber
      swabs in DNA recovery due to their innovative design and lack of internal
      absorbent core to entrap cellular materials. The microFLOQ((R)) Direct swab, a
      miniaturized version of the 4N6 FLOQSwab((R)), has a small swab head that is
      treated with a lysing agent which allows for direct amplification and DNA
      profiling from sample collection to final result in less than two hours.
      Additionally, the microFLOQ((R)) system subsamples only a minute portion of a
      stain and preserves the vast majority of the sample for subsequent testing or
      re-analysis, if desired. The efficacy of direct amplification of DNA from dilute 
      bloodstains, saliva stains, and touch samples was evaluated using microFLOQ((R)) 
      Direct swabs and the GlobalFiler Express system. Comparisons were made to
      traditional methods to assess the robustness of this alternate workflow.
      Controlled studies with 1:19 and 1:99 dilutions of bloodstains and saliva stains 
      consistently yielded higher STR peak heights than standard methods with 1ng input
      DNA from the same samples. Touch samples from common items yielded single source 
      and mixed profiles that were consistent with primary users of the objects. With
      this novel methodology/workflow, no sample loss occurs and therefore more
      template DNA is available during amplification. This approach may have important 
      implications for analysis of low quantity and/or degraded samples that plague
      forensic casework.

AB  - Children spend a large proportion of their school day engaged in tasks that
      require manual dexterity. If children experience difficulties with their manual
      dexterity skills it can have a consequential effect on their academic
      achievement. The first aim of this paper was to explore whether an online
      interactive typing intervention could improve children's scores on a standardised
      measure of manual dexterity. The second aim was to implement a serial reaction
      time tapping task as an index of children's finger movement learning, and to see 
      whether performance on this task would improve after the intervention.
      Seventy-eight typically developing children aged between 8 and 10 were tested at 
      their school on the pre-intervention Movement Assessment Battery for Children
      (2nd edition; MABC-2) and tapping tasks. Twenty-eight of these children
      volunteered to be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group.
      Children in the intervention group had a choice of two online games to play at
      home over a period of four weeks, while the children in the control group were
      not given these games to play. The intervention and control groups were then
      re-tested on the MABC-2 manual dexterity and the tapping task. Children in the
      intervention group significantly improved their manual dexterity scores in the
      MABC-2 compared to the control group. On average, all children learnt the tapping
      sequence, however, there were no group differences and no effect of the
      intervention on the tapping task. These results have important implications for
      implementing a freely available, easy to administer, fun and interactive
      intervention to help children improve their manual dexterity skills.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a robust and sensitive
      LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determinations of various tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs) in biological samples and to apply the method to their
      pharmacokinetic studies. Processed samples were injected into the UHPLC system
      coupled to an ESI-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The compounds were
      separated on an AcQuity UHPLC BEH C18 column (50mmx2.1mm ID, 1.7mum) using a
      gradient elution of acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid in water. The mass analysis was
      performed in an API 3200 Qtrap mass spectrometer via selective reaction
      monitoring operated under a positive scanning mode. The method was validated over
      a linear range of 3.13-800nM for erlotinib; 6.25-1600nM for sunitinib, pazopanib,
      and axitinib; and 12.5-3200nM for sorafenib, dasatinib, lapatinib, and nilotinib,
      respectively. The intra-day and inter-day precision were <16.7% for quality
      control samples of the analytes at the low concentration level and <13.7% for all
      other concentrations. The accuracy (bias) for all analytes at three different
      concentration levels ranged from -12.2% to 15.0%. The recovery, matrix effect,
      and stability were all in the range of acceptance. Only 10mul of blood were
      needed, demonstrating the method's high sensitivity. The presented method was
      shown to be suitable for the analysis of serial blood samples collected from each
      mouse in a pharmacokinetic study, after the oral administration of 11 TKIs (each 
      at 1mg/kg) as a mixture.

TI  - Identification of HSP70 gene in Corythucha ciliata and its expression profiles
      under laboratory and field thermal conditions.
LID - 10.1007/s12192-017-0840-7 [doi]
AB  - Previous laboratory studies have demonstrated that insects can tolerate high
      temperatures by expressing inducible heat shock proteins (HSPs). This HSP-based
      tolerance, however, has seldom been studied under field conditions. Here, we
      cloned the HSP70 gene of Corythucha ciliata (Cchsp70), an invasive insect species
      with substantial thermal tolerance in subtropical China. We also compared the
      relative mRNA expression levels of Cchsp70 in response to controlled temperature 
      treatments (2 h at 33-43 degrees C at 2 degrees C intervals in the laboratory)
      and to natural increases in temperature (08:00-14:00 at 2-h intervals, 29.7-37.2 
      degrees C) on a hot summer day in the field. The complete cDNA of Cchsp70 is 2256
      bp long and has a 1917 bp open reading frame that encodes a protein (CcHSP70)
      with 639 amino acids. The expression levels of Cchsp70 significantly increased in
      response to high temperatures in both laboratory and field. At similar
      temperatures, however, the expression levels were much higher in the field than
      in the laboratory. These results suggest that CcHSP70 contributes to the thermal 
      tolerance of C. ciliata and that factors in addition to thermal stress may induce
      Cchsp70 expression in the field.

TI  - Evaluations of Insecticides and Fungicides for Reducing Attack Rates of a new
      invasive ambrosia beetle (Euwallacea Sp., Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) 
      in Infested Landscape Trees in California.
PG  - 1611-1618

AB  - A recently discovered ambrosia beetle with the proposed common name of
      polyphagous shot hole borer (Euwallacea sp., Coleoptera: Curculionidae:
      Scolytinae), is reported to attack >200 host tree species in southern California,
      including many important native and urban landscape trees. This invasive beetle, 
      along with its associated fungi, causes branch dieback and tree mortality in a
      large variety of tree species including sycamore (Platanus racemosa Nutt.). Due
      to the severity of the impact of this Euwallacea sp., short-term management tools
      must include chemical control options for the arboriculture industry and private 
      landowners to protect trees. We examined the effectiveness of insecticides,
      fungicides, and insecticide-fungicide combinations for controlling continued
      Euwallacea sp. attacks on previously infested sycamore trees which were monitored
      for 6 mo after treatment. Pesticide combinations were generally more effective
      than single pesticide treatments. The combination of a systemic insecticide
      (emamectin benzoate), a contact insecticide (bifenthrin), and a fungicide
      (metconazole) provided some level of control when applied on moderate and heavily
      infested trees. The biological fungicide Bacillus subtilis provided short-term
      control. There was no difference in the performance of the three triazole
      fungicides (propiconazole, tebuconazole, and metconazole) included in this study.
      Although no pesticide combination provided substantial control over time,
      pesticide treatments may be more effective when trees are treated during early
      stages of attack by this ambrosia beetle.

TI  - Internal validation of an automated system for brachial and femoral flow mediated
      dilation.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/s40885-017-0073-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD) has immense potential to become a
      clinical, non-invasive biomarker of endothelial function and nitric oxide
      bioavailability, which regulate vasomotor activity. Unfortunately, FMD analysis
      techniques could deviate significantly in different laboratories if a validation 
      process is not involved. The purpose of this study was to provide validation to
      the assessment of FMD analysis in our laboratory and to standardize this process 
      before reporting results of FMD. METHODS: Brachial and femoral arteries FMD were 
      performed on 28 apparently healthy participants (15 male and 13 female, ages
      18-35 years). For the intratester reliability study, nine subjects were asked to 
      come to the lab for a second brachial FMD within 48 h. All FMD procedures were
      performed by the same investigator, while the FMD analyses were performed by 2
      independent testers who were blind to each other's analyses. FMD analyses
      included baseline artery diameter measurements, peak artery diameter after 5 min 
      of ischemia, and FMD. Analysis was completed via an automated edge detection
      system by both testers after training of the methodical process of analysis to
      minimize variability. Intratester and intertester reliability were determined by 
      using coefficient of variation (CV) between first and second visit (intratester) 
      and between results obtained by both testers (intertester). RESULTS: The
      intratester CVs for tester 1 and 2 were 3.28 and 2.62%, 3.74 and 3.27%, and 4.95 
      and 2.38% for brachial baseline artery diameter, brachial peak artery dilation,
      and brachial FMD, respectively. In the intertester CVs were 2.40, 3.16, and 3.37%
      for brachial baseline artery diameter, peak artery dilation, and FMD,
      respectively and 4.52, 5.50, and 3.46% for femoral baseline artery diameter, peak
      artery dilation, and FMD, respectively. CONCLUSION: All CVs were under or around 
      5%, confirming a strong reliability of the method. Our laboratory has shown that 
      the FMD protocol is reproducible due to the significantly low coefficient of
      variation. This is one step closer to use FMD as a biomarker for endothelial
      function in our laboratory.

TI  - Natural development of dermal ectopic bone in the american alligator (Alligator
      mississippiensis) resembles heterotopic ossification disorders in humans.
PG  - 56-76
LID - 10.1002/ar.23682 [doi]
AB  - Heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs when soft tissues are inappropriately
      converted to bony tissue. Several human diseases result in HO with few reliable
      treatment options. Animal models that naturally produce dermal ectopic bone
      (i.e., osteoderms), such as crocodilians, have never been utilized as models for 
      studying these disorders in humans. Here, a histological evaluation and staging
      criteria for osteoderm development is described for the first time in the
      American alligator (Alligator mississipiensis). Differential staining and
      immunohistochemistry of alligator scales depict a progressive change during
      development, where woven bone forms from the differentiated dermis. Bone
      formation proceeds via intramembranous ossification, which is initiated in part
      by endothelial cell precursors that undergo endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition
      and eventually acquire an osteoblast phenotype. As such, the development of
      osteoderms in the American alligator bears morphological and mechanistic
      similarities to HO in humans, presenting a potential model for future study of
      soft tissue mineralization pathologies and providing insight into the
      morphological and molecular development of osteoderms in other vertebrate
      lineages. Anat Rec, 2017. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Anat Rec, 301:56-76,

LID - 10.1016/j.gerinurse.2017.07.004 [doi]
AB  - Older adults need exercise programs that correspond to age-related changes. The
      purpose of this study was to explore preliminary effects of an 8-week Qigong
      exercise intervention on the physical ability, functional and psychological
      health, and spiritual well-being of community-dwelling older adults. Forty-five
      community-dwelling adults with the mean age of 74.8 years participated a 1-h
      Health Qigong exercise session twice weekly for 8 weeks. The majority were female
      (84%) and white (91%), and lived with their spouse (49%). Physical ability (p <
      0.001), functional health (p = 0.001), balance (p < 0.001), functional reach (p <
      0.001), depression (p = 0.005), and spiritual well-being (p = 0.004) improved
      significantly after the 8-week intervention. Most participants perceived physical
      ability, mental health, and spiritual well-being benefits. No adverse events were
      reported. A twice weekly Qigong exercise program over 8 weeks is feasible and has
      potential to improve physical ability, functional health, balance, psychological 
      health, and spiritual well-being in older adults.

TI  - Epiphytes in wooded pastures: Isolation matters for lichen but not for bryophyte 
      species richness.
PG  - e0182065
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0182065 [doi]
AB  - Sylvo-pastoral systems are species-rich man-made landscapes that are currently
      often severely threatened by abandonment or management intensification. At low
      tree densities, single trees in these systems represent habitat islands for
      epiphytic cryptogams. Here, we focused on sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus)
      wooded pastures in the northern European Alps. We assessed per tree species
      richness of bryophytes and lichens on 90 sycamore maple trees distributed across 
      six study sites. We analysed the effects of a range of explanatory variables
      (tree characteristics, environmental variables and isolation measures) on the
      richness of epiphytic bryophytes and lichens and various functional subgroups
      (based on diaspore size, habitat preference and red list status). Furthermore, we
      estimated the effect of these variables on the occurrence of two specific
      bryophyte species (Tayloria rudolphiana, Orthotrichum rogeri) and one lichen
      species (Lobaria pulmonaria) of major conservation concern. Bryophytes and
      lichens, as well as their subgroups, were differently and sometimes contrastingly
      affected by the variables considered: tree diameter at breast height had no
      significant effect on bryophytes but negatively affected many lichen groups; tree
      phenological age positively affected red-listed lichens but not red-listed
      bryophytes; increasing isolation from neighbouring trees negatively affected
      lichens but not bryophytes. However, the high-priority bryophyte species T.
      rudolphiana was also negatively affected by increased isolation at small spatial 
      scales. Orthotrichum rogeri was more frequent on young trees and L. pulmonaria
      was more frequent on trees with thin stems and large crowns. The results indicate
      that local dispersal is important for lichens, whereas long distance dispersal
      seems to be more important for colonisation by bryophytes. Furthermore, our study
      highlights that different conservation measures need to be taken depending on the
      taxonomic and functional species group or the individual species that is
      addressed. In practice, for the conservation of a high overall richness in
      sylvo-pastoral systems, it is crucial to sustain not only old and large trees but
      rather a wide range of tree sizes and ages.

      opportunities to leverage the critical balance between DNA injury and repair.
      Blocking repair and pushing damaged DNA through the cell cycle using therapeutic 
      inhibitors exemplify the 'pushmi-pullyu' effect of disrupted DNA repair. DNA
      repair inhibitors (DNARi) can be separated into five biofunctional categories:
      sensors, mediators, transducers, effectors, and collaborators that recognize DNA 
      damage, propagate injury DNA messages, regulate cell cycle checkpoints, and alter
      the microenvironment. The result is cancer therapeutics that takes advantage of
      clinical synthetic lethality, resulting in selective tumor cell kill. Here, we
      review recent considerations related to DNA repair and new DNARi agents and
      organize those findings to address future directions and clinical opportunities.

AB  - The study of protein phosphorylation is critical for the advancement of our
      understanding of cellular responses to external and internal stimuli.
      Phosphorylation, the addition of phosphate groups, most often occurs on serine,
      threonine, or tyrosine residues due to the action of protein kinases. This
      structural change causes the protein to become activated (or deactivated) and
      enables it in turn to initiate the phosphorylation of other proteins in a
      cascade, eventually causing cell-wide changes such as apoptosis, cell
      differentiation, and growth (among others). Cellular phosphoprotein pathway
      dysregulation by mutation or chromosomal instability can often give the cell a
      selective advantage and lead to cancer. Obviously the understanding of these
      systems is of huge importance to the field of oncology.This chapter aims to
      provide a "how to" manual for one such technology, the 96-well plate-based
      xMAP((R)) platform from Luminex. The system utilizes antibody-bound free-floating
      magnetic spheres which can easily be removed from suspension via magnetization.
      There are 100 unique bead sets (moving up to 500 bead sets for the most recent
      system) identified by the ratio of two dyes coating the microsphere. Each bead
      set is conjugated to a specific antibody which allows targeted protein extraction
      from low-concentration lysate solution. Biotinylated secondary
      antibodies/streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin (SAPE) complexes provide the
      quantification mechanism for the phosphoprotein of interest.

TI  - Art therapy and music reminiscence activity in the prevention of cognitive
      decline: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 324
LID - 10.1186/s13063-017-2080-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention has shifted to the use of non-pharmacological interventions
      to prevent cognitive decline as a preventive strategy, as well as for those at
      risk and those with mild cognitive impairment. Early introduction of
      psycho-social interventions can address cognitive decline and significantly
      impact quality of life and the wellbeing of elderly individuals. This pilot study
      explores the feasibility of using art therapy and music reminiscence activity to 
      improve the cognition of community living elderly with mild cognitive impairment.
      METHODS/DESIGN: This open-label, interventional study involves a parallel
      randomized controlled trial design with three arms (two intervention arms and a
      control group) over a nine-month period. Participants will be community-living
      elderly individuals aged 60-85 years, both genders, who meet predefined inclusion
      and exclusion criteria. In the initial three months, interventions will be
      provided weekly and for the remaining six months fortnightly. A sample size of 90
      participants is targeted based on expected neuropsychological test performance, a
      primary outcome measure, and drop-out rates. The randomization procedure will be 
      carried out via a web-based randomization system. Interventions will be provided 
      by trained staff with a control group not receiving any intervention but
      continuing life as usual. Assessments will be done at baseline, three months, and
      nine months, and include neuroimaging to measure cerebral changes and
      neuropsychological tests to measure for changes in cognition. Secondary outcome
      measures will include mood changes in anxiety and depression and telomere
      lengths. Statistical analysis will be undertaken by statisticians; all efficacy
      analysis will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. Primary and
      secondary outcomes will be modeled using the linear mixed model for repeated
      measurements and further analysis may be undertaken to adjust for potential
      confounders. DISCUSSION: This will be the first study to compare the
      effectiveness of art therapy and music reminiscence activity in a randomized
      controlled trial. We expect that the trial will provide useful evidence for
      developing psychosocial interventions for the elderly with mild cognitive
      impairment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered on 7 July 2016 at
      Clinical Trials.gov, a service of the US National Institute of Health (
      NCT02854085 ), retrospectively.

TI  - Additive effect of calcium depletion and low resource quality on Gammarus
      fossarum (Crustacea, Amphipoda) life history traits.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-9390-x [doi]
AB  - Gammarus fossarum is an often-abundant crustacean detritivore that contributes
      importantly to leaf litter breakdown in oligotrophic, mainly heterotrophic,
      headwater streams. This species requires large amounts of Ca to moult, thus
      allowing growth and reproduction. Because resource quality is tightly coupled to 
      the organism's growth and physiological status, we hypothesised that low Ca
      concentration [Ca] and low food resource quality (low phosphorus [P] and/or
      reduced highly unsaturated fatty acid [HUFA] contents) would interactively impair
      molecular responses (gene expression) and reproduction of G. fossarum. To
      investigate the effects of food resources quality, we experimentally manipulated 
      the P content of sycamore leaves and also used diatoms because they contain high 
      amounts of HUFAs. Three resource quality treatments were tested: low quality (LQ,
      unmanipulated leaves: low P content), high quality 1 (HQ1; P-manipulated leaves: 
      high P content), and high quality 2 (unmanipulated leaves supplemented with a
      pellet containing diatoms: high P and HUFA content). Naturally, demineralised
      stream water was supplemented with CaSO4 to obtain three Ca concentrations (2,
      3.5, and 10.5 mg Ca L(-1)). For 21 days, pairs of G. fossarum were individually
      exposed to one of the nine treatments (3 [Ca] x 3 resource qualities). At the
      individual level, strong and significant delays in moult stage were observed in
      gammarids exposed to lower [Ca] and to lower resource quality, with additive
      effects lengthening the duration of the reproductive cycle. Effects at the
      molecular level were investigated by measuring expression of 12 genes involved in
      energy production, translation, or Ca or P homeostasis. Expression of ATP
      synthase beta (higher in HQ2), calcified cuticle protein (higher in HQ1 and HQ2),
      and tropomyosin (higher in HQ2 compared to HQ1) was significantly affected by
      resource quality, and significant additive effects on Ca transporting ATPase
      expression were induced by [Ca] and resource quality (higher for low [Ca] and
      higher resource quality). These results highlight the potential drastic
      deleterious effects of water [Ca] depletion on G. fossarum physiology,
      populations, and ecosystem functioning, especially in oligotrophic environments.

TI  - Understanding the mechanisms of dormancy in an invasive alien Sycamore lace bug, 
      Corythucha ciliata through transcript and metabolite profiling.
PG  - 2631
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-02876-w [doi]
AB  - The sycamore lace bug, Corythucha ciliata, is a pest of sycamore trees. In China,
      it is found in the most northern border where it has been known to become dormant
      during harsh winters. But the molecular and metabolic basis for dormancy in this 
      insect is still unknown. In this study, we analyzed the transcript and metabolite
      profiles of this bug to identify key genes and metabolites that are significantly
      regulated during dormancy in adult females and males. In total, 149
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly up-regulated and 337
      DEGs were significantly down-regulated in dormant adults (both females and
      males). We found major differences in heat shock protein (HSPs),
      immunity-responsive genes, NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and genes 
      involved in the spliceosome pathway that is known to regulate stress. Among the
      62 metabolites identified by GC-MS, 12 metabolites including glycerol, trehalose,
      and alanine were significantly increased during C. ciliata dormancy. By
      integrating the transcriptome and metabolite datasets, we found that the
      metabolites in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and citrate cycle (TCA) were
      significantly reduced. This study is the first to report both transcript and
      metabolite profiles of the overwintering responses of C. ciliata to cold stress
      at the molecular level.

TI  - Evidence for self-organization in determining spatial patterns of stream
      nutrients, despite primacy of the geomorphic template.
PG  - E4744-E4752

AB  - Nutrients in freshwater ecosystems are highly variable in space and time.
      Nevertheless, the variety of processes contributing to nutrient patchiness, and
      the wide range of spatial and temporal scales at which these processes operate,
      obfuscate how this spatial heterogeneity is generated. Here, we describe the
      spatial structure of stream nutrient concentration, quantify the relative
      importance of the physical template and biological processes, and detect and
      evaluate the role of self-organization in driving such patterns. We examined
      nutrient spatial patterns in Sycamore Creek, an intermittent desert stream in
      Arizona that experienced an ecosystem regime shift [from a gravel/algae-dominated
      to a vascular plant-dominated (hereafter, "wetland") system] in 2000 when cattle 
      grazing ceased. We conducted high-resolution nutrient surveys in surface water
      along a 10-km stream reach over four visits spanning 18 y (1995-2013) that
      represent different successional stages and prewetland stage vs. postwetland
      state. As expected, groundwater upwelling had a major influence on nutrient
      spatial patterns. However, self-organization realized by the mechanism of spatial
      feedbacks also was significant and intensified over ecosystem succession, as a
      resource (nitrogen) became increasingly limiting. By late succession, the effects
      of internal spatial feedbacks and groundwater upwelling were approximately equal 
      in magnitude. Wetland establishment influenced nutrient spatial patterns only
      indirectly, by modifying the extent of surface water/groundwater exchange. This
      study illustrates that multiple mechanisms interact in a dynamic way to create
      spatial heterogeneity in riverine ecosystems, and provides a means to detect
      spatial self-organization against physical template heterogeneity as a dominant
      driver of spatial patterns.

TI  - Adalimumab plus Methotrexate for Uveitis in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.
PG  - 1637-1646
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1614160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adalimumab, a fully human anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha monoclonal
      antibody, is effective in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
      We tested the efficacy of adalimumab in the treatment of JIA-associated uveitis. 
      METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial,
      we assessed the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in children and adolescents 2
      years of age or older who had active JIA-associated uveitis. Patients who were
      taking a stable dose of methotrexate were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to
      receive either adalimumab (at a dose of 20 mg or 40 mg, according to body weight)
      or placebo, administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks. Patients continued the
      trial regimen until treatment failure or until 18 months had elapsed. They were
      followed for up to 2 years after randomization. The primary end point was the
      time to treatment failure, defined according to a multicomponent intraocular
      inflammation score that was based on the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature 
      criteria. RESULTS: The prespecified stopping criteria were met after the
      enrollment of 90 of 114 patients. We observed 16 treatment failures in 60
      patients (27%) in the adalimumab group versus 18 treatment failures in 30
      patients (60%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.12 to 0.49; P<0.0001 [the prespecified stopping boundary]). Adverse
      events were reported more frequently in patients receiving adalimumab than in
      those receiving placebo (10.07 events per patient-year [95% CI, 9.26 to 10.89]
      vs. 6.51 events per patient-year [95% CI, 5.26 to 7.77]), as were serious adverse
      events (0.29 events per patient-year [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.43] vs. 0.19 events per
      patient-year [95% CI, 0.00 to 0.40]). CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab therapy controlled 
      inflammation and was associated with a lower rate of treatment failure than
      placebo among children and adolescents with active JIA-associated uveitis who
      were taking a stable dose of methotrexate. Patients who received adalimumab had a
      much higher incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events than those who
      received placebo. (Funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme and

AB  - Corythucha ciliata (Say), an invasive pest originating from North America, causes
      severe damage on sycamore trees. However, little is known about the population
      genetics and evolutionary forces underlying the invasiveness of this important
      pest. In the present study, we use three mitochondrial genes (COI, ND1 and ND5)
      and nine microsatellite markers to investigate the population genetics of C.
      ciliata and retrace its spread through China. The results suggest a low level of 
      genetic diversity in Chinese and European populations of C. ciliata. Our results 
      indicate that populations of C. ciliata have obvious genetic structure, and
      genetic differentiation is not caused by geographic isolation. In median-joining 
      networks, we observed a higher frequency of shared haplotypes in groups 1 and 3. 
      Based on gene flow and approximate Bayesian computation analyses, we discovered
      that C. ciliata first invaded the east coast of China and subsequently moved
      inland. Demographic analysis suggested that populations of C. ciliata in China
      may have undergone a recent bottleneck effect. Finally, our results suggest that 
      population structure, high gene flow and environmental conditions have favored
      the broad invasiveness of this important pest.

TI  - The shifting phenological landscape: Within- and between-species variation in
      leaf emergence in a mixed-deciduous woodland.
PG  - 1135-1147
LID - 10.1002/ece3.2718 [doi]
AB  - Many organisms rely on synchronizing the timing of their life-history events with
      those of other trophic levels-known as phenological matching-for survival or
      successful reproduction. In temperate deciduous forests, the extent of matching
      with the budburst date of key tree species is of particular relevance for many
      herbivorous insects and, in turn, insectivorous birds. In order to understand the
      ecological and evolutionary forces operating in these systems, we require
      knowledge of the factors influencing leaf emergence of tree communities. However,
      little is known about how phenology at the level of individual trees varies
      across landscapes, or how consistent this spatial variation is between different 
      tree species. Here, we use field observations, collected over 2 years, to
      characterize within- and between-species differences in spring phenology for 825 
      trees of six species (Quercus robur, Fraxinus excelsior, Fagus sylvatica, Betula 
      pendula, Corylus avellana, and Acer pseudoplatanus) in a 385-ha woodland. We
      explore environmental predictors of individual variation in budburst date and bud
      development rate and establish how these phenological traits vary over space.
      Trees of all species showed markedly consistent individual differences in their
      budburst timing. Bud development rate also varied considerably between
      individuals and was repeatable in oak, beech, and sycamore. We identified
      multiple predictors of budburst date including altitude, local temperature, and
      soil type, but none were universal across species. Furthermore, we found no
      evidence for interspecific covariance of phenology over space within the
      woodland. These analyses suggest that phenological landscapes are highly complex,
      varying over small spatial scales both within and between species. Such spatial
      variation in vegetation phenology is likely to influence patterns of selection on
      phenology within populations of consumers. Knowledge of the factors shaping the
      phenological environments experienced by animals is therefore likely to be key in
      understanding how these evolutionary processes operate.

TI  - Identification, distribution, and quantification of biominerals in a deciduous
      forest.
PG  - 296-310
LID - 10.1111/gbi.12223 [doi]
AB  - Biomineralization is a common process in most vascular plants, but poorly
      investigated for trees. Although the presence of calcium oxalate and silica
      accumulation has been reported for some tree species, the chemical composition,
      abundance, and quantification of biominerals remain poorly documented. However,
      biominerals may play important physiological and structural roles in trees,
      especially in forest ecosystems, which are characterized by nutrient-poor soils. 
      In this context, our study aimed at investigating the morphology, distribution,
      and relative abundance of biominerals in the different vegetative compartments
      (foliage, branch, trunk, and root) of Fagus sylvatica L. and Acer pseudoplatanus 
      L. using a combination of scanning electron microscopy and tomography analyses.
      Biomineral crystallochemistry was assessed by X-ray diffraction and
      energy-dispersive X-ray analyses, while calcium, silicon, and oxalic acid were
      quantified in the compartments and at the forest scale. Our analyses revealed
      that biominerals occurred as crystals or coating layers mostly in bark and leaves
      and were identified as opal, whewellite, and complex biominerals. In both tree
      species, opal was mostly found in the external tissues of trunk, branch, and
      leaves, but also in the roots of beech. In the stand, opal represents around 170 
      kg/ha. Whewellite was found to suit to conductive tissues (i.e., axial phloem
      parenchyma, vascular bundles, vessel element) in all investigated compartments of
      the two tree species. The shape of whewellite was prismatic and druses in beech, 
      and almost all described shapes were seen in sycamore maple. Notably, the amount 
      of whewellite was strongly correlated with the total calcium in all investigated 
      compartments whatever the tree species is, suggesting a biologic control of
      whewellite precipitation. The amount of whewellite in the aboveground biomass of 
      Montiers forest was more important than that of opal and was around 1170 kg/ha.
      Therefore, biominerals contribute in a substantial way to the biogeochemical
      cycles of silicon and calcium.

TI  - Reading the Leaves' Palm: Leaf Traits and Herbivory along the Microclimatic
      Gradient of Forest Layers.
PG  - e0169741
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0169741 [doi]
AB  - Microclimate in different positions on a host plant has strong direct effects on 
      herbivores. But little is known about indirect effects due to changes of leaf
      traits. We hypothesized that herbivory increases from upper canopy to lower
      canopy and understory due to a combination of direct and indirect pathways.
      Furthermore, we hypothesized that herbivory in the understory differs between
      tree species in accordance with their leaf traits. We investigated herbivory by
      leaf chewing insects along the vertical gradient of mixed deciduous forest stands
      on the broad-leaved tree species Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech) with study
      sites located along a 140 km long transect. Additionally, we studied juvenile
      Acer pseudoplatanus L. (sycamore maple) and Carpinus betulus L. (hornbeam)
      individuals within the understory as a reference of leaf traits in the same
      microclimate. Lowest levels of herbivory were observed in upper canopies, where
      temperatures were highest. Temperature was the best predictor for insect
      herbivory across forest layers in our study. However, the direction was opposite 
      to the generally known positive relationship. Herbivory also varied between the
      three tree species with lowest levels for F. sylvatica. Leaf carbon content was
      highest for F. sylvatica and probably indicates higher amounts of phenolic
      defense compounds. We conclude that the effect of temperature must have been
      indirect, whereby the expected higher herbivory was suppressed due to unfavorable
      leaf traits (lower nitrogen content, higher toughness and carbon content) of
      upper canopy leaves compared to the understory.

LID - 10.1038/nrclinonc.2016.96 [doi]
AB  - Our increasing understanding of cancer biology has led to the development of
      molecularly targeted anticancer drugs. The full potential of these agents has
      not, however, been realised, owing to the presence of de novo (intrinsic)
      resistance, often resulting from compensatory signalling pathways, or the
      development of acquired resistance in cancer cells via clonal evolution under the
      selective pressures of treatment. Combinations of targeted treatments can
      circumvent some mechanisms of resistance to yield a clinical benefit. We explore 
      the challenges in identifying the best drug combinations and the best combination
      strategies, as well as the complexities of delivering these treatments to
      patients. Recognizing treatment-induced toxicity and the inability to use
      continuous pharmacodynamically effective doses of many targeted treatments
      necessitates creative intermittent scheduling. Serial tumour profiling and the
      use of parallel co-clinical trials can contribute to understanding mechanisms of 
      resistance, and will guide the development of adaptive clinical trial designs
      that can accommodate hypothesis testing, in order to realize the full potential
      of combination therapies.

TI  - Antibacterial Activities of Metabolites from Platanus occidentalis (American
      sycamore) against Fish Pathogenic Bacteria.
LID - 364 [pii]
AB  - One approach to the management of common fish diseases in aquaculture is the use 
      of antibiotic-laden feed. However, there are public concerns about the use of
      antibiotics in agriculture and the potential development of antibiotic resistant 
      bacteria. Therefore, the discovery of other environmentally safe natural
      compounds as alternatives to antibiotics would benefit the aquaculture
      industries. Four natural compounds, commonly called platanosides, [kaempferol
      3-O-alpha-L-(2'',3''-di-E-p-coumaroyl)rhamnoside (1), kaempferol
      3-O-alpha-L-(2''-E-p-coumaroyl-3''-Z-p-coumaroyl)rhamnoside (2), kaempferol
      3-O-alpha-L-(2''-Z-p-coumaroyl-3''-E-p-coumaroyl)rhamnoside (3), and kaempferol
      3-O-alpha-L-(2'',3''-di-Z-p-coumaroyl)rhamnoside (4)] isolated from the leaves of
      the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) tree were evaluated using a rapid
      bioassay for their antibacterial activities against common fish pathogenic
      bacteria including Flavobacterium columnare, Edwardsiella ictaluri, Aeromonas
      hydrophila, and Streptococcus iniae. The four isomers and a mixture of all four
      isomers were strongly antibacterial against isolates of F. columnare and S.
      iniae. Against F. columnare ALM-00-173, 3 and 4 showed the strongest
      antibacterial activities, with 24-h 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) values of
      2.13 +/- 0.11 and 2.62 +/- 0.23 mg/L, respectively. Against S. iniae LA94-426, 4 
      had the strongest antibacterial activity, with 24-h IC50 of 1.87 +/- 0.23 mg/L.
      Neither a mixture of the isomers nor any of the individual isomers were
      antibacterial against isolates of E. ictaluri and A. hydrophila at the test
      concentrations used in the study. Several of the isomers appear promising for the
      potential management of columnaris disease and streptococcosis in fish.

TI  - Low rate of cetuximab hypersensitivity reactions in Northeast Tennessee: An
      Appalachian effect?
PG  - 784-789
AB  - PURPOSE: Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody with a known risk of hypersensitivity
      reactions. Early studies showed hypersensitivity reaction rates of 3%, but there 
      appears to be a higher incidence in the southeastern United States. To confirm
      the findings from nearby institutions that cetuximab-associated hypersensitivity 
      reactions occur in approximately 20% of patients in the southeastern United
      States. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at Johnson City
      Medical Center in Johnson City, Tennessee. Each patient's first infusion was
      analyzed for hypersensitivity reaction, as well as for demographic information
      such as allergy and smoking history, pre-medications, and malignancy type.
      RESULTS: Data from the first infusion of cetuximab were collected for a total of 
      71 patients with various malignancies. The overall rate of grade 3 or higher
      hypersensitivity reaction was 1.4%, and total rate of hypersensitivity reaction
      was 8.5%. These findings more closely correlate to the early clinical trials and 
      package insert. Both severe (p = 0.001) and any-grade (p = 0.002)
      hypersensitivity reaction occurred less frequently in one Southeastern
      Appalachian medical center compared to academic medical centers directly to the
      east and west. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in southern Appalachia may be less likely to
      develop cetuximab hypersensitivity reactions compared to surrounding areas in the
      Southeastern U.S. These results lend support to the theory that exposure to
      lonestar ticks (Amblyomma americanum) may be responsible for the development of
      IgE antibodies to cetuximab that cause hypersensitivity reactions. The
      development of quick and reliable bedside predictors of cetuximab
      hypersensitivity reactions may aid clinicians considering the use of cetuximab.

TI  - More comprehensive forensic genetic marker analyses for accurate human remains
      identification using massively parallel DNA sequencing.
PG  - 750
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the primary objective of forensic DNA analyses of
      unidentified human remains is positive identification, cases involving historical
      or archaeological skeletal remains often lack reference samples for comparison.
      Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) offers an opportunity to provide biometric
      data in such cases, and these cases provide valuable data on the feasibility of
      applying MPS for characterization of modern forensic casework samples. In this
      study, MPS was used to characterize 140-year-old human skeletal remains
      discovered at a historical site in Deadwood, South Dakota, United States. The
      remains were in an unmarked grave and there were no records or other metadata
      available regarding the identity of the individual. Due to the high throughput of
      MPS, a variety of biometric markers could be typed using a single sample.
      RESULTS: Using MPS and suitable forensic genetic markers, more relevant
      information could be obtained from a limited quantity and quality sample. Results
      were obtained for 25/26 Y-STRs, 34/34 Y SNPs, 166/166 ancestry-informative SNPs, 
      24/24 phenotype-informative SNPs, 102/102 human identity SNPs, 27/29 autosomal
      STRs (plus amelogenin), and 4/8 X-STRs (as well as ten regions of mtDNA). The
      Y-chromosome (Y-STR, Y-SNP) and mtDNA profiles of the unidentified skeletal
      remains are consistent with the R1b and H1 haplogroups, respectively. Both of
      these haplogroups are the most common haplogroups in Western Europe.
      Ancestry-informative SNP analysis also supported European ancestry. The genetic
      results are consistent with anthropological findings that the remains belong to a
      male of European ancestry (Caucasian). Phenotype-informative SNP data provided
      strong support that the individual had light red hair and brown eyes.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to genetically characterize historical
      human remains with forensic genetic marker kits specifically designed for MPS.
      The outcome demonstrates that substantially more genetic information can be
      obtained from the same initial quantities of DNA as that of current CE-based
      analyses.

TI  - Potential tree species for use in urban areas in temperate and oceanic climates.
PG  - e00154
AB  - This study aims to assess the potential of trees for integration in urban
      development by evaluating the damage caused by trees in relation to various tree 
      characteristics. Tree damage to permeable pavement systems and other urban
      structures such as impermeable pavements, kerbs, roads, retaining walls,
      footpaths, walls and buildings were assessed to identify the most suitable trees 
      for the urban environment. One hundred square sites of 100 m x 100 m were
      randomly selected in Greater Manchester for this representative example case
      study to demonstrate the assessment methodology. Among tree species in this
      study, Acer platanoides L. (Norway maple) occurred most frequently (17%); others 
      were Tilia spp. L. (Lime; 16%), Fraxinus excelsior L. (common ash; 12%), Acer
      pseudoplatanus L. (sycamore; 10%) and Prunus avium L. (wild cherry; 8%). The
      study concludes that 44% of the damage was to impermeable pavements and 22% to
      permeable pavements. Other damage to structures included kerbs (19%), retaining
      walls (5%), footpaths (4%), roads (3%) and walls (3%). Concerning the severity of
      damage, 66% were moderate, 21% light and 19% severe. Aesculus hippocastanum L.
      (horse chestnut) caused the greatest damage (59%) expressed in percentage as a
      ratio of the tree number related to damage over the corresponding tree number
      that was found close to structures.

AB  - Atypical myopathy (AM) is a potentially fatal disease of grazing horses. It is
      reportedly caused by the ingestion of sycamore seeds containing toxic hypoglycin 
      A. In order to study metabolic changes, serum and urine samples from nine horses 
      with atypical myopathy and 12 control samples from clinically healthy horses were
      collected and then analysed using a high-performance liquid chromatography
      coupled with tandem mass spectrometry; serum metabolic profiles as the disease
      progressed were also studied. Metabolic data were evaluated using unsupervised
      and supervised multivariate analyses. Significant differences were demonstrated
      in the concentrations of various glycine conjugates and acylcarnitines (C2-C26). 
      Moreover, the concentrations of purine and pyrimidine metabolites, vitamins and
      their degradation products (riboflavin, trigonelline, pyridoxate, pantothenate), 
      and selected organic and amino acids (aspartate, leucine, 2-oxoglutarate, etc.)
      were altered in horses with AM. These results represent a global view of altered 
      metabolism in horses with atypical myopathy.

      behavioural alterations in a coral reef fish.

AB  - Neurosensory and behavioural disruptions are some of the most consistently
      reported responses upon exposure to ocean acidification-relevant CO2 levels,
      especially in coral reef fishes. The underlying cause of these disruptions is
      thought to be altered current across the GABAA receptor in neuronal cells due to 
      changes in ion gradients (HCO3(-) and/or Cl(-)) that occur in the body following 
      compensation for elevated ambient CO2. Despite these widely-documented
      behavioural disruptions, the present study is the first to pair a behavioural
      assay with measurements of relevant intracellular and extracellular acid-base
      parameters in a coral reef fish exposed to elevated CO2. Spiny damselfish
      (Acanthochromis polyacanthus) exposed to 1900 muatm CO2 for 4 days exhibited
      significantly increased intracellular and extracellular HCO3(-) concentrations
      and elevated brain pHi compared to control fish, providing evidence of CO2
      compensation. As expected, high CO2 exposed damselfish spent significantly more
      time in a chemical alarm cue (CAC) than control fish, supporting a potential link
      between behavioural disruption and CO2 compensation. Using HCO3(-) measurements
      from the damselfish, the reversal potential for GABAA (EGABA) was calculated,
      illustrating that biophysical properties of the brain during CO2 compensation
      could change GABAA receptor function and account for the behavioural disturbances
      noted during exposure to elevated CO2.

TI  - Carbon dynamics of Acer pseudoplatanus seedlings under drought and complete
      darkness.
PG  - 1400-1408
AB  - Carbon (C) storage is considered a key component to plant survival under drought 
      and shade, although the combined effects of these factors on survival remain
      poorly understood. We investigated how drought and shade alter the C dynamics and
      survival of tree seedlings, and whether drought limits the access to or usage of 
      stored C. We experimentally applied two levels of soil humidity (well-watered
      versus drought, the latter induced by dry-down) and light availability (light
      versus complete darkness) on 1-year-old seedlings of Acer pseudoplatanus L. for 3
      months. We quantified the survival, biomass, growth rate and non-structural
      carbohydrates (NSC) of seedlings at their time of death or at the end of the
      experiment for those that survived. We found that the soil dried out faster when 
      drought was combined with light than when it was combined with complete darkness.
      Seedlings subjected to both drought and light showed reduced growth and reached
      100% mortality earlier than any other treatment, with the highest NSC
      concentrations at the time of death. Seedlings exposed to both drought and
      complete darkness died significantly earlier than seedlings exposed to complete
      darkness only, but had similar NSC concentrations at time of their death,
      suggesting that drought accelerated the use of stored C under complete darkness. 
      Complete darkness significantly reduced seedling growth and whole-plant NSC
      concentrations regardless of soil humidity, while root NSC concentrations were
      significantly more reduced when complete darkness was combined with drought
      conditions. Thus, the C dynamics in A. pseudoplatanus seedlings under complete
      darkness was not hindered by drought, i.e., the access and use of stored C was
      not limited by drought. The contrasting growth and C storage responses driven by 
      drought under light versus complete darkness are consistent with a key role of
      the drought progression in the C dynamics of trees.

AB  - Infection control is the discipline responsible for preventing health
      care-associated infections (HAIs) and has grown from an anonymous field, to a
      highly visible, multidisciplinary field of incredible importance. There has been 
      increasing focus on prevention rather than control of HAIs. Infection prevention 
      programs (IPPs) have enormous scope that spans multiple disciplines. Infection
      control and the prevention and elimination of HAIs can no longer be
      compartmentalized. This article discusses the structure and responsibilities of
      an IPP, the regulatory pressures and opportunities that these programs face, and 
      how to build and manage a successful program.

      ciliata (Hemiptera: Tingidae) Transcriptome.

AB  - The sycamore lace bug, Corythucha ciliata (Hemiptera: Tingidae), is an invasive
      forestry pest rapidly expanding in many countries. This pest poses a considerable
      threat to the urban forestry ecosystem, especially to Platanus spp. However, its 
      molecular biology and biochemistry are poorly understood. This study reports the 
      first C. ciliata transcriptome, encompassing three different life stages (Nymphs,
      adults female (AF) and adults male (AM)). In total, 26.53 GB of clean data and
      60,879 unigenes were obtained from three RNA-seq libraries. These unigenes were
      annotated and classified by Nr (NCBI non-redundant protein sequences), Nt (NCBI
      non-redundant nucleotide sequences), Pfam (Protein family), KOG/COG (Clusters of 
      Orthologous Groups of proteins), Swiss-Prot (A manually annotated and reviewed
      protein sequence database), and KO (KEGG Ortholog database). After all pairwise
      comparisons between these three different samples, a large number of
      differentially expressed genes were revealed. The dramatic differences in global 
      gene expression profiles were found between distinct life stages (nymphs and AF, 
      nymphs and AM) and sex difference (AF and AM), with some of the significantly
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) being related to metamorphosis, digestion, 
      immune and sex difference. The different express of unigenes were validated
      through quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) for 16 randomly selected unigenes.
      In addition, 17,462 potential simple sequence repeat molecular markers were
      identified in these transcriptome resources. These comprehensive C. ciliata
      transcriptomic information can be utilized to promote the development of
      environmentally friendly methodologies to disrupt the processes of metamorphosis,
      digestion, immune and sex differences.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Reference: Zhang Y, Davis JK, Casa DJ, Bishop PA. Optimizing cold
      water immersion for exercise-induced hyperthermia: a meta-analysis. Med Sci
      Sports Exerc. 2015;47(11):2464-2472. Clinical Questions: Do optimal procedures
      exist for implementing cold-water immersion (CWI) that yields high cooling rates 
      for hyperthermic individuals? DATA SOURCES: One reviewer performed a literature
      search using PubMed and Web of Science. Search phrases were cold water immersion,
      forearm immersion, ice bath, ice water immersion, immersion, AND cooling. STUDY
      SELECTION: Studies were included based on the following criteria: (1) English
      language, (2) full-length articles published in peer-reviewed journals, (3)
      healthy adults subjected to exercise-induced hyperthermia, and (4) reporting of
      core temperature as 1 outcome measure. A total of 19 studies were analyzed. DATA 
      EXTRACTION: Pre-immersion core temperature, immersion water temperature, ambient 
      temperature, immersion duration, and immersion level were coded a priori for
      extraction. Data originally reported in graphical form were digitally converted
      to numeric values. Mean differences comparing the cooling rates of CWI with
      passive recovery, standard deviation of change from baseline core temperature,
      and within-subjects r were extracted. Two independent reviewers used the
      Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale to assess the risk of bias. MAIN
      RESULTS: Cold-water immersion increased the cooling rate by 0.03 degrees C/min
      (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.03, 0.04 degrees C/min) compared with passive
      recovery. Cooling rates were more effective when the pre-immersion core
      temperature was >/=38.6 degrees C (P = .023), immersion water temperature was
      </=10 degrees C (P = .036), ambient temperature was >/=20 degrees C (P = .013),
      or immersion duration was </=10 minutes (P < .001). Cooling rates for torso and
      limb immersion (mean difference = 0.04 degrees C/min, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.06 degrees
      C/min) were higher (P = .028) than those for forearm and hand immersion (mean
      difference = 0.01 degrees C/min, 95% CI = -0.01, 0.04 degrees C/min).
      CONCLUSIONS: Hyperthermic individuals were cooled twice as fast by CWI as by

      treating patients with exertional heat stroke. Water temperature should be <10
      degrees C, with the torso and limbs immersed. Insufficient published evidence
      supports CWI of the forearms and hands.

AB  - Equine atypical myopathy in Europe is a fatal rhabdomyolysis syndrome that
      results from the ingestion of hypoglycin A contained in seeds and seedlings of
      Acer pseudoplatanus (sycamore maple). Acylcarnitine concentrations in serum and
      muscle OXPHOS capacity were determined in 15 atypical myopathy cases. All but one
      acylcarnitine were out of reference range and mitochondrial respiratory capacity 
      was severely decreased up to 49% as compared to 10 healthy controls. The hallmark
      of atypical myopathy thus consists of a severe alteration in the energy
      metabolism including a severe impairment in muscle mitochondrial respiration that
      could contribute to its high death rate.

      ORAL 1,4-DIOXANE.
PG  - 135-43
AB  - 1,4-Dioxane (DX) with two oxygen atoms make it hydrophilic and infinitely soluble
      in water. As a synthetic organic compound, it used widely throughout industry as 
      a solvent. Dioxane causes numerous human ailments such as liver damage and kidney
      failure. It has been shown in research to be carcinogenic to animals, and is a
      potential carcinogen to humans. Daily administration for 1,4-dioxane (100 mg/kg
      body weight) in drinking water for rats weighing 120 g, except for normal control
      group. Experimental animal for 42 days was followed through body weight, serum
      alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, malondialdehyde, and catalase enzyme
      activity; beside histological patterns for liver, kidney, brain and ovary
      sections. Protection treatment has been offered using oral injection N-acetyl
      cysteine (100 mg/kg b.wt.), and fresh 200 mg/kg b.wt. in diet meal for each of
      nabk, husk, and sycamore in separated groups. Body weight and CAT activity have
      decreased by 25.8, and 68.7%, respectively. While increase has found in MDA, ALP 
      and creatinine values by 76, 48.9, and 67.3%, respectively. NAC showed
      improvement especially for MDA peroxidation marker and creatinine for kidney
      disorder. On the other hand, nabk improved CAT activity and husk for ALP liver
      mutagenicity marker. Intoxicated DX showed edema, kupffer cell activation,
      atrophy of glomerular tuft, and necrosis of neurons in liver, kidney and brain
      sections. Obviously nabk showed highly improvement in liver toxicity which is the
      most sensitive organ to DX as found in research.

AB  - Elevated sulphur dioxide (SO2) concentrations were the major cause of the absence
      of symptoms of tar spot (Rhytisma acerinum) of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), in
      urban areas in the 1970s. The subsequent large decline in SO2 concentrations has 
      not always been accompanied by increased tar spot symptoms, for reasons that have
      remained unresolved. We used a large citizen science survey, providing over 1000 
      records across England, to test two competing hypotheses proposed in earlier
      studies. We were able to demonstrate the validity of both hypotheses; tar spot
      symptoms were reduced where there were fewer fallen leaves as a source of
      inoculum, and elevated nitrogen dioxide concentrations reduced tar spot symptoms 
      above a threshold concentration of about 20 mug m(-3). Symptom severity was also 
      lower at sites with higher temperature and lower rainfall. Our findings
      demonstrate the power of citizen science to resolve competing hypotheses about
      the impacts of air pollution and other environmental drivers.

AB  - Terrestrial plants are ideal sentinels of environmental pollution, due to their
      sedentary nature, abundance and sensitivity to atmospheric changes. However,
      reliable and sensitive biomarkers of exposure have hitherto been difficult to
      characterise. Biospectroscopy offers a novel approach to the derivation of
      biomarkers in the form of discrete molecular alterations detectable within a
      biochemical fingerprint. We investigated the application of this approach for the
      identification of biomarkers for pollution exposure using the common sycamore
      (Acer pseudoplatanus) as a sentinel species. Attenuated total reflection
      Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to interrogate leaf
      tissue collected from three sites exposed to different levels of vehicle exhaust 
      emissions. Following multivariate analysis of acquired spectra, significant
      biochemical alterations were detected between comparable leaves from different
      sites that may constitute putative biomarkers for pollution-induced stress. These
      included differences in carbohydrate and nucleic acid conformations, which may be
      indicative of sub-lethal exposure effects. We also observed several corresponding
      spectral alterations in both the leaves of A. pseudoplatanus exposed to ozone
      pollution under controlled environmental conditions and in leaves infected with
      the fungal pathogen Rhytisma acerinum, indicating that some stress-induced
      changes are conserved between different stress signatures. These similarities may
      be indicative of stress-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation,
      although further work is needed to verify the precise identity of infrared
      biomarkers and to identify those that are specific to pollution exposure. Taken
      together, our data clearly demonstrate that biospectroscopy presents an effective
      toolkit for the utilisation of higher plants, such as A. pseudoplatanus, as
      sentinels of environmental pollution.

TI  - Hypoglycin A Concentrations in Maple Tree Species in the Netherlands and the
      Occurrence of Atypical Myopathy in Horses.
PG  - 880-4
LID - 10.1111/jvim.13927 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atypical myopathy (AM) in horses is caused by the plant toxin
      hypoglycin A, which in Europe typically is found in the sycamore maple tree (Acer
      pseudoplatanus). Owners are concerned about whether their horses are in danger if
      they graze near maple trees. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To measure hypoglycin A in
      the most common maple tree species in the Netherlands, and to determine whether
      concentration of toxin is a predictor of AM in horses. METHODS: A total of 278
      samples of maple tree leaves, sprouts, and seeds were classified by species. Mean
      concentrations of hypoglycin A were compared for the type of sample, the season
      and the occurrence of AM in the pasture (non-AM versus AM). Statistical analysis 
      was performed using generalized a linear model (SPPS22). RESULTS: Almost all Acer
      pseudoplatanus samples contained hypoglycin A, with concentrations differing
      significantly among sources (P < .001). Concentrations were significantly higher 
      in seeds from the AM group than in seeds from the non-AM group (856 +/- 677 and
      456 +/- 358 mg/kg, respectively; P = .039). In sprouts and leaves this was not
      the case. Acer platanoides and Acer campestre samples did not contain detectable 
      concentrations of hypoglycin A. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Acer
      platanoides and campestre seem to be safe around paddocks and pastures, whereas
      almost all Acer pseudoplatanus samples contained hypoglycin A. In all AM cases,
      Acer pseudoplatanus was found. Despite significantly higher concentration of
      hypoglycin A in seeds of pastures where AM has occurred, individual prediction of
      AM cannot be made by measuring these concentrations because of the high standard 
      deviation.

AB  - Acer pseudoplatanus seeds are characterized by a deep physiological embryo
      dormancy that requires a few weeks of cold stratification in order to promote
      germination. Understanding the function of proteins and their related metabolic
      pathways, in conjunction with the plant hormones implicated in the breaking of
      seed dormancy, would expand our knowledge pertaining to this process. In this
      study, a proteomic approach was used to analyze the changes occurring in seeds in
      response to cold stratification, which leads to dormancy release. In addition,
      the involvement of abscisic (ABA) and gibberellic acids (GA) was also examined.
      Fifty-three proteins showing significant changes were identified by mass
      spectrometry. An effect of ABA on protein variation was observed at the beginning
      of stratification, while the influence of GA on protein abundance was observed
      during the middle phase of stratification. The majority of proteins associated
      with dormancy breaking in the presence of only water, and also ABA or GA, were
      classified as being involved in metabolism and genetic information processing.
      For metabolic-related proteins, the effect of ABA on protein abundance was
      stimulatory for half of the proteins and inhibitory for half of the proteins. On 
      the other hand, the effect on genetic information processing related proteins was
      stimulatory. GA was found to upregulate both metabolic-related and genetic
      information processing-related proteins. While seed dormancy breaking depends on 
      proteins involved in a variety of processes, proteins associated with methionine 
      metabolism (adenosine kinase, methionine synthase) and glycine-rich RNA binding
      proteins appear to be of particular importance.

TI  - Anatomical "C"-shaped double-bundle versus single-bundle anterior cruciate
      ligament reconstruction in pre-adolescent children with open growth plates.
PG  - 796-806
LID - 10.1007/s00167-016-4039-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyse the clinical, rotational and radiological (MRI) results of
      paediatric anatomical "C-shaped" double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament
      (ACL) reconstruction with anteromedial and posteromedial bundle compared to
      single-bundle (SB) ACL reconstruction. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2014, 57
      consecutive patients received a paediatric ACL reconstruction with open physis
      and were allocated into two groups, according to the surgical procedure.
      Transepiphyseal SB technique was used until 2012 and DB consecutively thereafter.
      Follow-up consisted of a clinical evaluation with assessment of the International
      Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, the Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity
      score, KT-1000 arthrometer evaluation, VAS Scores for satisfaction, MRI and
      testing of rotational stability using a robotic system. RESULTS: The mean time
      from ACL reconstruction to follow-up was 48.1 +/- 15.8 in the SB group (n = 17)
      and 23.1 +/- 13.2 in the DB group (n = 16; p < 0.001). No differences were found 
      in the subjective scores. Biomechanically, there were significant differences
      identified in the KT-1000 (p < 0.03) and total tibial axial rotation (p < 0.04)
      when evaluating the reconstructed knee only. Ten of 17 (59%) of the SB patients
      had a Joint Play Area within the acceptable range of the median healthy knee
      value compared to 100 % in the DB group. Decreased patient satisfaction was
      associated with increased total tibial axial rotation. No growth disturbance was 
      observed. Overall, 98% of patients were reached and either examined or
      interviewed. Re-rupture rate was 3 of 21 (14.3%) for DB and 9 of 35 (25.7%) for
      SB. All but one re-ruptures (92%) happened in the first 16 postoperative months
      independent of technique. CONCLUSIONS: The re-rupture rate after pre-adolescent
      ACL reconstruction is too high both historically and in this mixed cohort.
      Anatomical transepiphyseal DB ACL reconstruction with open physis may result in a
      reduction in this re-rupture rate, which may be related to a tighter control of
      the Joint Play Area. While subjective clinical results were similar between SB
      and DB, decreased patient satisfaction was associated with increased total tibial
      axial rotation in the entire cohort. Despite the need for two transepiphyseal
      tunnels in the DB technique, there did not appear to be an increased risk in
      growth plate disturbance. Transepiphyseal DB ACL reconstruction appears to be a
      reasonable alternative to current techniques in pre-adolescent children with an
      ACL rupture. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

TI  - Partial body weight support treadmill training speed influences paretic and
      non-paretic leg muscle activation, stride characteristics, and ratings of
      perceived exertion during acute stroke rehabilitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive task-specific training is promoted as one approach for
      facilitating neural plastic brain changes and associated motor behavior gains
      following neurologic injury. Partial body weight support treadmill training
      (PBWSTT), is one task-specific approach frequently used to improve walking during
      the acute period of stroke recovery (<1month post infarct). However, only limited
      data have been published regarding the relationship between training parameters
      and physiologic demands during this early recovery phase. OBJECTIVE: To examine
      the impact of four walking speeds on stride characteristics, lower extremity
      muscle demands (both paretic and non-paretic), Borg ratings of perceived exertion
      (RPE), and blood pressure. DESIGN: A prospective, repeated measures design was
      used. METHODS: Ten inpatients post unilateral stroke participated. Following
      three familiarization sessions, participants engaged in PBWSTT at four
      predetermined speeds (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0mph) while bilateral electromyographic
      and stride characteristic data were recorded. RPE was evaluated immediately
      following each trial. RESULTS: Stride length, cadence, and paretic single limb
      support increased with faster walking speeds (p0.001), while non-paretic single
      limb support remained nearly constant. Faster walking resulted in greater peak
      and mean muscle activation in the paretic medial hamstrings, vastus lateralis and
      medial gastrocnemius, and non-paretic medial gastrocnemius (p0.001). RPE also was
      greatest at the fastest compared to two slowest speeds (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      During the acute phase of stroke recovery, PBWSTT at the fastest speed (2.0mph)
      promoted practice of a more optimal gait pattern with greater intensity of effort
      as evidenced by the longer stride length, increased between-limb symmetry,
      greater muscle activation, and higher RPE compared to training at the slowest
      speeds.

AB  - Forensic and ancient DNA samples often are damaged and in limited quantity as a
      result of exposure to harsh environments and the passage of time. Several
      strategies have been proposed to address the challenges posed by degraded and low
      copy templates, including a PCR based whole genome amplification method called
      degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR (DOP-PCR). This study assessed the efficacy
      of four modified versions of the original DOP-PCR primer that retain at least a
      portion of the 5' defined sequence and alter the number of bases on the 3' end.
      The use of each of the four modified primers resulted in improved STR profiles
      from environmentally-damaged bloodstains, contemporary human skeletal remains,
      American Civil War era bone samples, and skeletal remains of WWII soldiers over
      those obtained by previously described DOP-PCR methods and routine STR typing.
      Additionally, the modified DOP-PCR procedure allows for a larger volume of DNA
      extract to be used, reducing the need to concentrate the sample and thus
      mitigating the effects of concurrent concentration of inhibitors.

TI  - Onset of analgesia with ibuprofen sodium in tension-type headache: a randomized
      trial.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/s40780-015-0012-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ibuprofen is known to be efficacious in the treatment of tension-type
      headache, the most common form of primary headache. A novel tablet formulation of
      ibuprofen sodium is more rapidly absorbed than standard ibuprofen. This study
      evaluated onset of analgesia and overall efficacy of ibuprofen sodium in
      episodic-type tension headache (ETTH) compared with standard ibuprofen and
      placebo. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, single-center, parallel-group
      study included adults aged 18-65 years with >/=4 moderately severe ETTHs per
      month for 6 months. Within 45 minutes of onset of at least moderately severe
      ETTH, subjects were randomized 2:2:1 to receive a single oral dose of ibuprofen
      sodium tablets (Advil(R) Film Coated; 2 x 256 mg [equivalent to 400 mg standard
      ibuprofen]), standard ibuprofen tablets (Motrin(R); 2 x 200 mg), or placebo. The 
      coprimary end points were time-weighted sum of pain relief rating and pain
      intensity difference scores over 3 hours (SPRID 0-3) and time to meaningful pain 
      relief (MPR) assessed by double-stopwatch method. RESULTS: A total of 226
      subjects were randomized to ibuprofen sodium (n = 91), standard ibuprofen (n =
      89), and placebo (n = 46). Demographics and baseline characteristics were
      comparable between treatment groups. Mean SPRID 0-3 scores were significantly
      superior (P < .001) for ibuprofen sodium (9.6) and standard ibuprofen (9.8)
      versus placebo (3.5), but were not significantly different from each other (P =
      .812). Time to MPR was significantly (P < .001) shorter for ibuprofen sodium and 
      standard ibuprofen compared with placebo (median 40.6, 48.5, and >180 minutes,
      respectively). Time to MPR was numerically faster for ibuprofen sodium than
      standard ibuprofen. This difference was not statistically significant (P = .253) 
      using the protocol-specified analysis but was (P = .022) in a post hoc analysis
      using the Gehan-Wilcoxon test, which assigns higher weights to earlier events.
      (The post hoc analysis was performed because Kaplan-Meier graphs and results for 
      time to first perceptible relief favored ibuprofen sodium over standard ibuprofen
      at earlier time points.) There were no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This novel
      ibuprofen sodium tablet provided rapid, efficacious relief of ETTH and was well
      tolerated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01362491.

TI  - Experiential self-understanding.
PG  - 305-32
LID - 10.1111/1745-8315.12365 [doi]
AB  - The notion of insight is at one and the same time central to psychoanalysis and
      to the self-understanding that is part of everyday life. Through clinical
      material and critical engagement with contemporary philosophical work on
      self-knowledge, this paper clarifies one crucial aspect of this key notion.
      Self-understanding of the sort we have in mind, while of course involving
      cognitive elements, is not sufficiently accounted for by cognition about one's
      affects, motivations, or other aspects of the psyche, nor by the simple
      conjunction of such cognition with felt affect, motivational urges, etc. Nor is
      it best modelled in terms of internal self-observation. Rather, it is the product
      of an ongoing process of the unfolding articulation of one's psychic life. The
      notion of experience is important here in three ways. First, lived experience is 
      that out of which the self-understanding arises. Second, this self-understanding 
      is a development and articulation of these aspects of our inner lives; it is a
      part of that same lived perspective. And third, this understanding in turn shapes
      one's experience of one's inner world: as it is attained, one's experience of
      oneself thereby changes. Central here is the emphasis upon a developing process
      involving the ability to speak from one's subjective perspective while
      experiencing one's subjective perspective as the perspective that it is.

TI  - Seasonal variation in N uptake strategies in the understorey of a beech-dominated
      N-limited forest ecosystem depends on N source and species.
PG  - 589-600
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpv132 [doi]
AB  - In forest ecosystems, species use different strategies to increase their
      competitive ability for nitrogen (N) acquisition. The acquisition of N by trees
      is regulated by tree internal and environmental factors including mycorrhizae. In
      this study, we investigated the N uptake strategies of three co-occurring tree
      species [European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus
      L.) and Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.)] in the understorey of a
      beech-dominated, N-limited forest on calcareous soil over two consecutive
      seasons. For this purpose, we studied (15)N uptake capacity as well as the
      allocation to N pools in the fine roots. Our results show that European beech had
      a higher capacity for both inorganic and organic N acquisition throughout the
      whole growing season compared with sycamore maple and Norway maple. The higher
      capacity of N acquisition in beech indicates a better adaption of beech to the
      understorey conditions of beech forests compared with the seedlings of other tree
      competitors under N-limited conditions. Despite these differences, all three
      species preferred organic over inorganic N sources throughout the growing season 
      and showed similar seasonal patterns of N acquisition with an increased N uptake 
      capacity in summer. However, this pattern varied with N source and year
      indicating that other environmental factors not assessed in this study further
      influenced N acquisition by the seedlings of the three tree species.

TI  - New Gallotannin and other Phytochemicals from Sycamore Maple (Acer
      pseudoplatanus) Leaves.
PG  - 1977-80
AB  - The maple (Acer) genus is a reported source of bioactive (poly)phenols, including
      gallotannins, but several of its members, such as the sycamore maple (A.
      pseudoplatanus), remain uninvestigated. Herein, thirty-nine compounds, including 
      a new gallotannin, 1,2,3-tri-O-galloyl-6-O-(p-hydroxybenzoyl)-beta-D-
      glucopyranoside (1), and thirty-eight (2-39) known compounds, consisting of four 
      gallotannins, one ellagitannin, thirteen flavonoids, eight hydroxycinnamic acids,
      ten benzoic acid derivatives, and two sesquiterpenoids, were isolated from
      sycamore maple leaves. Their structures were determined based on NMR and mass
      spectral analyses. The isolates were evaluated for alpha-glucosidase inhibitory
      and antioxidant activities. Among the isolates, the gallotannins were the most
      potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitors with thirteen-fold more potent activity
      compared with the clinical drug, acarbose (IC50 = 16-31 vs. 218 microM).
      Similarly, the gallotannins showed the highest antioxidant activities, followed
      by the other phenolic sub-classes, while the sesquiterpenoids were inactive.

TI  - A regional programme to improve skin cancer management.
PG  - 339-44
AB  - BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: In 2008, public specialist and general practice services 
      in Canterbury were unable to manage demand for skin cancer treatment. Local
      clinicians decided the solution was to develop a see-and-treat skin excision
      clinic staffed by plastic surgeons and general practitioners (GPs), and the
      introduction of subsidised excisions in general practice. This paper describes
      the collaboration between clinicians, managers and funders and the results and
      quality management measures of these initiatives. ASSESSMENT OF PROBLEM: There is
      an increasing incidence of skin cancer. GPs in Canterbury were unable to meet
      increasing demand for skin cancer treatment because some lacked confidence and
      competence in skin cancer management. There was no public funding for primary
      care management of skin cancer, driving patients to fully funded secondary care
      services. Secondary care services were at capacity, with no coordinated programme
      across primary and secondary care. RESULTS: The programme has resulted in a
      greater number of skin cancers being treated by the public health system, a
      reduction in waiting times for treatment, and fewer minor skin lesions being
      referred to secondary care. Quality measures have been achieved and are improving
      steadily. Development of the programme has improved working relationships between
      primary and secondary care clinicians. STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVEMENT: The strategy
      was to facilitate the working relationship between primary and secondary care and
      increase the capacity for skin lesion excisions in both sectors. LESSONS: Skin
      cancer management can be improved by a coordinated approach between primary and
      secondary care.

TI  - Delivery Characteristics, Acceptability, and Depression Outcomes of a Home-based 
      Depression Intervention for Older African Americans: The Get Busy Get Better
      Program.
PG  - 956-65
LID - 10.1093/geront/gnv117 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To facilitate replication, we examined delivery
      characteristics, acceptability, and depression outcomes of a home-based
      intervention, Get Busy Get Better, Helping Older Adults Beat the Blues (GBGB).
      GBGB, previously tested in a randomized trial, reduced depressive symptoms and
      enhanced quality of life in African Americans. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 208
      African Americans aged above 55 years with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)
      scores >/=5 on two subsequent screenings were randomized to receive GBGB
      immediately or 4 months later. GBGB involves up to 10 home sessions consisting of
      care management, referral/linkage, depression education/symptom recognition,
      stress reduction, and behavioral activation. Interventionists recorded delivery
      characteristics (dose, intensity) and perceived acceptability of sessions.
      Baseline and post-tests were used to characterize participants and examine
      associations between dose/intensity and depression scores. Participant
      satisfaction and perceived benefits were examined at 8 months. RESULTS: Of 208
      participants, 181 (87%, mean age = 69.6) had treatment data. Of these, 165
      (91.2%) had >/=3 treatment sessions (minimal dose). Participants had on average
      8.1 sessions (SD = 2.6) for an average of 65.4min (SD = 18.3) each. Behavioral
      activation and care management were provided the most (average of six sessions
      for average duration = 17.9 and 22.2min per session respectively), although all
      participants received each treatment component. GBGB was perceived as highly
      acceptable and beneficial by interventionists and participants. More sessions and
      time in program were associated with greater symptom reduction. IMPLICATIONS:
      GBGB treatment components were highly acceptable to participants. Future
      implementation and sustainability challenges include staffing, training
      requirements, reimbursement limitations, competing agency programmatic
      priorities, and generalizability to other groups.

AB  - Bilateral chronic anterior uveitis is an extra-articular feature of juvenile
      idiopathic arthritis. Although figures vary, uveitis occurs in approximately
      11%-13% of patients with this disease and is most commonly associated with the
      female gender, oligoarthritis, and presence of antinuclear antibodies. The
      disease has an insidious onset and is often asymptomatic. Managing patients with 
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis remains challenging as the
      disease may prove to be refractory to traditional treatment regimens. Stepwise
      immunomodulatory therapy is indicated, with new biologic drugs being used last in
      cases of refractory uveitis. Small scale studies and practice have provided the
      evidence to undertake randomized control trials to evaluate the efficacy, safety,
      and cost-effectiveness of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapies, such as
      infliximab and adalimumab. These have demonstrated promising results, with
      further data awaited from ongoing trials for adalimumab (as SYCAMORE and ADJUVITE
      trials). Lower grade evidence is supporting the use of newer biologics such as
      rituximab, daclizumab, tocilizumab, and abatacept in those cases refractory to
      anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy.

TI  - Detection of hypoglycin A in the seeds of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and box 
      elder (A. negundo) in New Zealand; the toxin associated with cases of equine
      atypical myopathy.
PG  - 182-7
LID - 10.1080/00480169.2015.1123123 [doi]
AB  - CASE HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: During April and May 2014 four horses aged
      between 5 months and 9 years, located in the Canterbury, Marlborough and
      Southland regions, presented with a variety of clinical signs including
      recumbency, stiffness, lethargy, dehydration, depression, and myoglobinuria
      suggestive of acute muscle damage. Two horses were subjected to euthanasia and
      two recovered. In all cases seeds of sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) or box 
      elder (A. negundo) were present in the area where the horse had been grazing.
      LABORATORY INVESTIGATION: The samaras (seeds) of some Acer spp. may contain
      hypoglycin A, that has been associated with cases of atypical myopathy in Europe 
      and North America. To determine if hypoglycin A is present in the samaras of Acer
      spp. in New Zealand, samples were collected from trees throughout the country
      that were associated with historical and/or current cases of atypical myopathy,
      and analysed for hypoglycin A. Serum samples from the four cases and four
      unaffected horses were analysed for the presence of hypoglycin A, profiles of
      acylcarnitines (the definitive diagnosis for atypical myopathy) and activities of
      creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase.Markedly elevated serum activities
      of creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase, and increased concentrations
      of selected acylcarnitines were found in the case horses. Hypoglycin A was
      detected in the serum of those horses but not in the healthy controls. Hypoglycin
      A was detected in 10/15 samples of samaras from sycamore maple and box elder from
      throughout New Zealand. DIAGNOSIS: Cases of atypical myopathy were diagnosed on
      properties where samaras containing hypoglycin A were also found. CLINICAL
      RELEVANCE: Sycamore and box elder trees in New Zealand are a source of hypoglycin
      A associated with the development of atypical myopathy. If pastured horses
      present with clinical and biochemical signs of severe muscle damage then the
      environment should be checked for the presence of these trees. Horses should be
      prevented from grazing samaras from Acer spp. in the autumn.

TI  - Optimal adaptive sequential designs for crossover bioequivalence studies.
PG  - 15-27
LID - 10.1002/pst.1721 [doi]
AB  - In prior works, this group demonstrated the feasibility of valid adaptive
      sequential designs for crossover bioequivalence studies. In this paper, we extend
      the prior work to optimize adaptive sequential designs over a range of geometric 
      mean test/reference ratios (GMRs) of 70-143% within each of two ranges of
      intra-subject coefficient of variation (10-30% and 30-55%). These designs also
      introduce a futility decision for stopping the study after the first stage if
      there is sufficiently low likelihood of meeting bioequivalence criteria if the
      second stage were completed, as well as an upper limit on total study size. The
      optimized designs exhibited substantially improved performance characteristics
      over our previous adaptive sequential designs. Even though the optimized designs 
      avoided undue inflation of type I error and maintained power at >/= 80%, their
      average sample sizes were similar to or less than those of conventional single
      stage designs.

TI  - Substrate influences ecophysiological performance of tree seedlings.
PG  - 39-53
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpv104 [doi]
AB  - Unfavourable soil conditions frequently limit tree regeneration in mountain
      forests on calcareous bedrock. Rocky, shallow organic soils on dolomite pose a
      particular problem for tree regeneration due to commonly restricted water and
      nutrient supplies. Moreover, an often dense layer of understorey vegetation
      competes for the limited resources available. Hence, an array of interacting
      factors impairs tree seedlings' performance on dolomite, but there is little
      information on the ecophysiological mechanisms. We studied the effects of
      substrate, competing vegetation and foliar nutrient concentrations on the
      photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs) and leaf water potentials
      (psi) of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), spruce
      [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] and larch (Larix decidua Mill.) under controlled
      (well-watered/drought-stressed) conditions and under prevailing field conditions.
      While A and gs of well-watered spruce in the pot experiment were reduced by the
      mineral substrate, the organic dolomite substrate with dense competing vegetation
      reduced gs and psi of sycamore, spruce and larch under drought-stressed
      conditions in the field. For sycamore and spruce, A and gs were strongly
      correlated with foliar nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) concentrations in the pot
      experiment. In contrast, soil water primarily affected beech and larch. Finally, 
      dense competing vegetation negatively affected A and gs of spruce and A of larch 
      on dolomite. Our results highlight the critical role of N, K and water
      availability for tree seedlings in shallow soils on calcareous bedrock. On these 
      sites, natural tree regeneration is at particular risk from episodic drought, a
      likely consequence of climate change.

TI  - HPLC Plasma Assay of a Novel Anti-MRSA Compound,
      Kaempferol-3-O-Alpha-L-(2",3"-di-p-coumaroyl)rhamnoside, from Sycamore Leaves.
PG  - 1383-6
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a serious pathogen that is 
      resistant to current antibiotic therapy. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel 
      antimicrobial agents that can effectively combat these new strains of
      drug-resistant "superbugs". Recently, fractionation of an extract from Platanus
      occidentalis (American sycamore) leaves produced an active kaempferol molecule,
      3-O-alpha-L-(2",3"-di-p-coumaroyl)rhamnoside (KCR), in four isomeric forms; all
      four isomers exhibit potent anti-MRSA activity. In order to further the
      preclinical development of KCR as a new antibiotic class, we developed and
      validated a simple analytical method for assaying KCR plasma concentration.
      Because KCR will be developed as a new drug, although comprising four
      stereoisomers, the analytical method was devised to assay the total amount of all
      four isomers. In the present work, both a plasma processing procedure and an HPLC
      method have been developed and validated. Mouse plasma containing KCR was first
      treated with ethanol and then centrifuged. The supernatant was dried, suspended
      in ethanol, centrifuged, and the supernatant was injected into an HPLC system
      comprising a Waters C18, a mobile phase composing methanol, acetonitrile, and
      trifluoroacetic acid and monitored at 313 nm. The method was validated by
      parameters including a good linear correlation, a limit of quantification of 0.27
      microg/mL, and high accuracy. In summary, this method allows a rapid analysis of 
      KCR in the plasma samples for pharmacokinetics studies.

TI  - Identifying Community Perspectives for a Lung Cancer Screening Awareness Campaign
      in Appalachia Kentucky: The Terminate Lung Cancer (TLC) Study.
PG  - 125-134

AB  - Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan is now
      covered by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services following an evidence-based
      recommendation, but a shared decision making process should inform patients of
      risks and limitations. An awareness campaign promoting LDCT screenings is an
      opportunity to elicit patient engagement with health providers about the risks
      and benefits. Focus groups representing three regions of Appalachian Kentucky
      known for high lung cancer rates discussed development of a lung cancer screening
      campaign. Recommendations included messaging content, appeals or design, campaign
      implementation, and trusted information or communication sources. Community
      health workers (CHWs) from three Eastern Kentucky regions recruited individuals
      from their local communities using established client files. CHWs hosted six
      total focus groups (7-11 participants each) using questions guided by the
      Communication-Persuasion Matrix framework. All sessions were recorded and
      transcribed for independent content analysis. A total of 54 individuals (61.1 %
      female; >55 pack year history) were participated. Prior to discussion, most
      participants had not heard of lung cancer screening. Cited needs for content of a
      campaign included benefits of early detection and payment information. Messages
      considered most persuasive were those that include personal testimony, messages
      of hope, prolonged life, and an emphasis on family and the ambition to survive.
      Having information come from one's family doctor or specialty provider was
      considered important to message communication. Messages about survivorship,
      family, and prolonged life should be considered in lung cancer screening
      awareness campaigns. Our results provide community input about messages regarding
      screening options.

AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Hypoglycin A (HG) appears to cause atypical
      myopathy (AM), but to our knowledge, detection of HG in affected and unaffected
      horses and concurrently in plants that they were exposed to has not previously
      been reported. OBJECTIVES: To investigate HG in samples from horses exposed to
      Acer pseudoplatanus (European sycamore maple) and in such plant material, at the 
      time of clinical cases of AM in the herd. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
      METHODS: Blood was collected from 2 horses with AM and 22 clinically healthy
      co-grazing horses in 2 Swedish farms within one week of onset of signs (May 2014)
      and one month later, after horses were moved to other pastures. Ten healthy
      control horses from unaffected farms were sampled once. Samaras, seedlings,
      flowers and leaves from Acer pseudoplatanus and from Acer platanoides L (Norway
      maple) were collected from affected pastures. Hypoglycin A was analysed using
      chemical derivatisation with dansyl chloride (DNS) and ultra high performance
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Hypoglycin A was detected as
      derivatised compound HG-DNS [M+H]+ with selected reaction monitoring. RESULTS:
      Hypoglycin A was detected in the horses affected with AM, and also in 20 out of
      22 co-grazing horses. One month later, a surviving case horse and 9/20 co-grazing
      horses were still positive for HG. Controls from other farms were negative for
      HG. Hypoglycin A was detected in plant material from Acer pseudoplatanus, but not
      from Acer platanoides L. CONCLUSIONS: Horses grazing in pastures with
      HG-containing Acer pseudoplatanus were positive for HG in blood, and some showed 
      severe signs of myopathy. Ethical animal research: Ethical consent for blood
      sampling was granted (C113/11) and horse owners gave their informed consent to
      inclusion of horses in the study. SOURCE OF FUNDING: National Veterinary
      Institute, Sweden. Competing interests: None declared.

TI  - The associations between daily spring pollen counts, over-the-counter allergy
      medication sales, and asthma syndrome emergency department visits in New York
      City, 2002-2012.
PG  - 71
LID - 10.1186/s12940-015-0057-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many types of tree pollen trigger seasonal allergic illness, but
      their population-level impacts on allergy and asthma morbidity are not well
      established, likely due to the paucity of long records of daily pollen data that 
      allow analysis of multi-day effects. Our objective in this study was therefore to
      determine the impacts of individual spring tree pollen types on over-the-counter 
      allergy medication sales and asthma emergency department (ED) visits. METHODS:
      Nine clinically-relevant spring tree pollen genera (elm, poplar, maple, birch,
      beech, ash, sycamore/London planetree, oak, and hickory) measured in Armonk, NY, 
      were analyzed for their associations with over-the-counter allergy medication
      sales and daily asthma syndrome ED visits from patients' chief complaints or
      diagnosis codes in New York City during March 1st through June 10th, 2002-2012.
      Multi-day impacts of pollen on the outcomes (0-3 days and 0-7 days for the
      medication sales and ED visits, respectively) were estimated using a distributed 
      lag Poisson time-series model adjusting for temporal trends, day-of-week,
      weather, and air pollution. For asthma syndrome ED visits, age groups were also
      analyzed. Year-to-year variation in the average peak dates and the 10th-to-90th
      percentile duration between pollen and the outcomes were also examined with
      Spearman's rank correlation. RESULTS: Mid-spring pollen types (maple, birch,
      beech, ash, oak, and sycamore/London planetree) showed the strongest significant 
      associations with both outcomes, with cumulative rate ratios up to 2.0 per
      0-to-98th percentile pollen increase (e.g., 1.9 [95% CI: 1.7, 2.1] and 1.7 [95%
      CI: 1.5, 1.9] for the medication sales and ED visits, respectively, for ash).
      Lagged associations were longer for asthma syndrome ED visits than for the
      medication sales. Associations were strongest in children (ages 5-17; e.g., a
      cumulative rate ratio of 2.6 [95% CI: 2.1, 3.1] per 0-to-98th percentile increase
      in ash). The average peak dates and durations of some of these mid-spring pollen 
      types were also associated with those of the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Tree pollen
      peaking in mid-spring exhibit substantive impacts on allergy, and asthma
      exacerbations, particularly in children. Given the narrow time window of these
      pollen peak occurrences, public health and clinical approaches to anticipate and 
      reduce allergy/asthma exacerbation should be developed.

TI  - Studying Ancient Anthropogenic Impacts on Current Floral Biodiversity in the
      Southern Levant as reflected by the Philistine Migration.
PG  - 13308
LID - 10.1038/srep13308 [doi]
AB  - Human migrations across geographic boundaries can facilitate the introduction of 
      new husbandry practices and dispersal of plants and animals, resulting in changes
      in biodiversity. As previously demonstrated, the 12th century BCE Philistine
      migration-to the southern Levantine littoral, involved the transportation of pigs
      from Europe, engendering long term genetic displacement of local Near Eastern
      haplotypes. Building on this, and combining biogeographical methods of Floral
      List comparisons with archaeological data, we have elucidated the Philistine
      impact on Southern Levantine floral ecosystems. We demonstrate that previously
      unexploited local plants were incorporated into the Philistine milieu, and new
      species were introduced-from Europe, the Aegean, Egypt and Mesopotamia -resulting
      in the earliest locally cultivated sycamore, cumin, coriander, bay tree and opium
      poppy. This research has highlighted the impact of past cultures on the formation
      of floral ecosystems and their long-term effects on contemporary local biological
      diversity.

TI  - Samaras and seedlings of Acer pseudoplatanus are potential sources of hypoglycin 
      A intoxication in atypical myopathy without necessarily inducing clinical signs.
PG  - 414-7
LID - 10.1111/evj.12499 [doi]
AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Ingestion of sycamore seeds (Acer pseudoplatanus)
      is the likely source of hypoglycin A in atypical myopathy (AM) but ingestion of
      seedlings in spring might also contribute to intoxication. OBJECTIVES: To test
      for hypoglycin A in seeds and seedlings collected on pastures where AM cases were
      reported and compare its concentration in serum of affected and healthy horses.
      STUDY DESIGN: Field investigation of clinical cases. METHODS: Whenever present,
      samaras (the winged nuts that each contain one seed) and/or seedlings were
      collected from pastures of 8 AM cases and 5 unaffected horses from different
      premises. Two AM cases were each co-grazing with an apparently healthy horse.
      Acylcarnitines and hypoglycin A were quantified in blood samples of all horses
      involved in the study. RESULTS: Hypoglycin A was detected in serum of AM (5.47
      +/- 1.60 mumol/l) but not in healthy controls pasturing where A. pseudoplatanus
      trees were not present. However, hypoglycin A was detected at high concentrations
      (7.98 mumol/l) in serum of a clinically healthy horse grazing a pasture with
      seedlings and samaras and also in the 2 healthy horses co-grazing with AM cases
      (0.43 +/- 0.59 mumol/l). Hypoglycin A was detected in all samples of seeds and
      spring seedlings of A. pseudoplatanus. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical myopathy can be
      associated with the ingestion of sycamore samaras and also ingestion of
      seedlings. Hypoglycin A can be detected in the blood of horses with no detectable
      clinical signs at pasture in which there is A. pseudoplatanus. Determination of
      hypoglycin A concentration in blood is useful for screening for exposure in
      suspected cases of AM.

AB  - The structural and electronic properties of titanium oxide nanotubes (TiO2) have 
      attracted considerable attention for the development of therapeutic devices and
      imaging probes for nanomedicine. However, the fluorescence response of TiO2 has
      typically been within ultraviolet spectrum. In this study, the surface
      modification of TiO2 nanotubes with ZnS quantum dots was found to produce a red
      shift in the ultra violet emission band. The TiO2 nanotubes used in this work
      were obtained by sol-gel template synthesis. The ZnS quantum dots were deposited 
      onto TiO2 nanotube surface by a micelle-template inducing reaction. The structure
      and morphology of the resulting hybrid TiO2/ZnS nanotubes were investigated by
      scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray
      diffraction techniques. According to the results of fluorescence spectroscopy,
      pure TiO2 nanotubes exhibited a high emission at 380nm (3.26eV), whereas TiO2/ZnS
      exhibited an emission at 410nm (3.02eV). The TiO2/ZnS nanotubes demonstrated good
      bio-imaging ability on sycamore cultured plant cells. The biocompatibility
      against mammalian cells (Chinese Hamster Ovarian Cells-CHO) suggesting that
      TiO2/ZnS may also have suitable optical properties for use as biological markers 
      in diagnostic medicine. The drug release characteristic of TiO2/ZnS nanotubes was
      explored using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), an anticancer drug used in photodynamic
      therapy. The results show that the TiO2/ZnS nanotubes are a promising candidate
      for anticancer drug delivery systems.

TI  - Effective Research Strategies for Trainees in Internal Medicine Residency
      Programs.
LID - 10.4088/PCC.14r01712 [doi]
AB  - For most training programs, the development of research endeavors among trainees 
      is an ongoing challenge. In this article, we review various considerations when
      attempting to undertake research activities within an internal medicine residency
      training program, including availability of institutional resources (eg,
      dedicated research time for trainees and faculty, available faculty mentors,
      accessible adjunctive personnel), engagement of residents into research, classic 
      project quagmires in training programs, the institutional review board,
      publication options (eg, letters to the editor, case reports, literature reviews,
      original research reports), and journal submission strategies. Given that
      research entails multiple components and distinct skills, the overall program
      goal should be to make research an educationally understandable process for
      trainees. Research can be a rewarding activity when nurtured in a facilitating
      educational environment.

      Olive-Associated Strains of Xylella fastidiosa by Polymerase Chain Reaction.
PG  - e0129330
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0129330 [doi]
AB  - Xylella fastidiosa causes bacterial leaf scorch in many landscape trees including
      elm, oak, sycamore and mulberry, but methods for specific identification of a
      particular tree host species-limited strain or differentiation of tree-specific
      strains are lacking. It is also unknown whether a particular landscape
      tree-infecting X. fastidiosa strain is capable of infecting multiple landscape
      tree species in an urban environment. We developed two PCR primers specific for
      mulberry-infecting strains of X. fastidiosa based on the nucleotide sequence of a
      unique open reading frame identified only in mulberry-infecting strains among all
      the North and South American strains of X. fastidiosa sequenced to date. PCR
      using the primers allowed for detection and identification of mulberry-infecting 
      X. fastidiosa strains in cultures and in samples collected from naturally
      infected mulberry trees. In addition, no mixed infections with or non-specific
      detections of the mulberry-infecting strains of X. fastidiosa were found in
      naturally X. fastidiosa-infected oak, elm and sycamore trees growing in the same 
      region where naturally infected mulberry trees were grown. This genotype-specific
      PCR assay will be valuable for disease diagnosis, studies of strain-specific
      infections in insects and plant hosts, and management of diseases caused by X.
      fastidiosa. Unexpectedly but interestingly, the unique open reading frame
      conserved in the mulberry-infecting strains in the U. S. was also identified in
      the recently sequenced olive-associated strain CoDiRO isolated in Italy. When the
      primer set was tested against naturally infected olive plant samples collected in
      Italy, it allowed for detection of olive-associated strains of X. fastidiosa in
      Italy. This PCR assay, therefore, will also be useful for detection and
      identification of the Italian group of X. fastidiosa strains to aid understanding
      of the occurrence, evolution and biology of this new group of X. fastidiosa
      strains.

AB  - Competition for nitrogen (N), particularly in resource-limited habitats, might be
      avoided by different N acquisition strategies of plants. In our study, we
      investigated whether slow-growing European beech and fast-growing sycamore maple 
      seedlings avoid competition for growth-limiting N by different N uptake patterns 
      and the potential alteration by soil N availability in a microcosm experiment. We
      quantified growth and biomass indices, (15)N uptake capacity and N pools in the
      fine roots. Overall, growth indices, N acquisition and N pools in the fine roots 
      were influenced by species-specific competition depending on soil N availability.
      With inter-specific competition, growth of sycamore maple reduced regardless of
      soil N supply, whereas beech only showed reduced growth when N was limited. Both 
      species responded to inter-specific competition by alteration of N pools in the
      fine roots; however, sycamore maple showed a stronger response compared to beech 
      for almost all N pools in roots, except for structural N at low soil N
      availability. Beech generally preferred organic N acquisition while sycamore
      maple took up more inorganic N. Furthermore, with inter-specific competition,
      beech had an enhanced organic N uptake capacity, while in sycamore maple
      inorganic N uptake capacity was impaired by the presence of beech. Although
      sycamore maple could tolerate the suboptimal conditions at the cost of reduced
      growth, our study indicates its reduced competitive ability for N compared to
      beech.

TI  - Equine atypical myopathy caused by hypoglycin A intoxication associated with
      ingestion of sycamore maple tree seeds.
PG  - 418-21
LID - 10.1111/evj.12460 [doi]
AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Evidence suggest there is a link between equine
      atypical myopathy (EAM) and ingestion of sycamore maple tree seeds. OBJECTIVES:
      To further evaluate the hypothesis that the ingestion of hypoglycin A (HGA)
      containing sycamore maple tree seeds causes acquired multiple acyl-CoA
      dehydrogenase deficiency and might be associated with the clinical and
      pathological signs of EAM. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: Necropsy and
      histopathology, using hematoxylin and eosin and Sudan III stains, were performed 
      on a 2.5-year-old mare that died following the development of clinical signs of
      progressive muscle stiffness and recumbency. Prior to death, the animal ingested 
      sycamore maple tree seeds (Acer pseudoplatanus). Detection of metabolites in
      blood and urine obtained post mortem was performed by rapid ultra-performance
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Data from this case were compared
      with 3 geldings with no clinical history of myopathy. RESULTS: Macroscopic
      examination revealed fragments of maple tree seeds in the stomach and severe
      myopathy of several muscle groups including Mm. intercostales, deltoidei and
      trapezii. Histologically, the affected muscles showed severe, acute
      rhabdomyolysis with extensive accumulation of finely dispersed fat droplets in
      the cytoplasm of degenerated skeletal muscle cells not present in controls. Urine
      and serum concentrations of several acyl carnitines and acyl glycines were
      increased, and both contained metabolites of HGA, a toxic amino acid present in
      sycamore maple tree seeds. CONCLUSIONS: The study supports the hypothesis that
      ingestion of HGA-containing maple tree seeds may cause EAM due to acquired
      multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly transmissible
      coronavirus that causes a severe enteric disease that is particularly deadly for 
      neonatal piglets. Since its introduction to the United States in 2013, PEDV has
      spread quickly across the country and has caused significant financial losses to 
      pork producers. With no fully licensed vaccines currently available in the United
      States, prevention and control of PEDV disease is heavily reliant on biosecurity 
      measures. Despite proven, effective biosecurity practices, multiple sites and
      production stages, within and across designated production flows in an Ohio swine
      operation broke with confirmed PEDV in January 2014, leading the producer and
      attending veterinarian to investigate the route of introduction. CASE
      PRESENTATION: On January 12, 2014, several sows within a production flow were
      noted with signs of enteric illness. Within a few days, illness had spread to
      most of the sows in the facility and was confirmed by RT-PCR to be PEDV. Within a
      short time period, confirmed disease was present on multiple sites within and
      across breeding and post weaning production flows of the operation and mortality 
      approached 100% in neonatal piglets. After an epidemiologic investigation, an
      outsourced, pelleted piglet diet was identified for assessment, and a bioassay,
      where naive piglets were fed the suspected feed pellets, was initiated to test
      the pellets for infectious PEDV. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological investigation
      provided strong evidence for contaminated feed as the source of the outbreak. In 
      addition, feed pellets collected from unopened bags at the affected sites tested 
      positive for PEDV using RT-PCR. However, the bioassay study was not able to show 
      infectivity when feeding the suspected feed pellets to a small number of naive
      piglets. The results highlight the critical need for surveillance of feed and
      feed components to further define transmission avenues in an effort to limit the 
      spread of PEDV throughout the U.S. swine industry.

TI  - Religiosity/spirituality: Relationships with non-suicidal self-harm behaviors and

PG  - 762-7
LID - 10.1177/0020764015579738 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationships between religiosity/spirituality (RS) and self-harm
      behavior, including non-suicidal self-harm behavior (NS-SHB) and suicide
      attempts/completions, remain of keen interest. Whereas the majority of studies
      strongly suggest that RS protects against suicide attempts/completions,
      relationships between RS and NS-SHB have been rarely studied. AIM: In this study,
      we examined RS in relationship to both NS-SHB (six explicit behaviors) and past
      history of suicide attempts. METHOD: In a cross-sectional sample of 306
      consecutive primary care outpatients, we administered four self-report
      assessments for RS (extent participant considered self a religious person, extent
      participant considered self a spiritual person, extent religion is involved in
      understanding/dealing with stressful situations, Functional Assessment of Chronic
      Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being Scale (FACIT-Sp-12)) as well as examined
      seven items on the Self-Harm Inventory: six items reflecting NS-SHB and one item 
      reflecting a past suicide attempt. RESULTS: While two RS items yielded no
      significant findings (extent participant considered self a spiritual person,
      extent religion is involved in understanding/dealing with stressful situations), 
      the remaining two items were associated with a lowered risk of self-harm
      behavior, particularly the FACIT-Sp-12. CONCLUSIONS: Some but not all aspects of 
      RS are associated with lowered risk for self-harm. In this study, considering
      oneself a religious person and reporting a general sense of RS well-being offered
      the most protective effect to participants, particularly the latter.

      Estimation.
PG  - 966-73
LID - 10.1111/1556-4029.12774 [doi]
AB  - Angled/curved zygomaxillary suture coding is widely employed in cranial
      assessments of ancestry. However, the efficacy of this method has not been
      extensively evaluated across diverse populations. In this study, zygomaxillary
      suture morphology was assessed on a total of 411 human crania from six
      populations (European, Native American, African, Asian, Arctic Circle, and
      Aboriginal Australian) using a novel 3D coordinate landmark method. Our results
      indicate a predominance of angled sutures among native peoples of the Arctic and 
      North America (85-86%), a prevalence of curved sutures among Africans and
      Aboriginal Australians (77-81%), and essentially equal proportions of both
      configurations in Asians and Europeans (50-56%). Statistically, angled/curved
      coding generally discriminates poorly between groups, except when populations
      with antithetically high frequencies of the two configurations (e.g., African vs.
      Native American) are compared. Moreover, comparisons across previous studies
      reveal conflicting frequencies for many populations, further suggesting limited
      utility of this trait in ancestry estimation.

AB  - Bacterial leaf scorch, associated with the bacterial pathogen Xylella fastidiosa,
      is a widely established and problematic disease of landscape ornamentals in
      Washington D.C. A multi-locus sequence typing analysis was performed using 10
      housekeeping loci for X. fastidiosa strains in order to better understand the
      epidemiology of leaf scorch disease in this municipal environment. Samples were
      collected from 7 different tree species located throughout the District of
      Columbia, consisting of 101 samples of symptomatic and asymptomatic foliage from 
      84 different trees. Five strains of the bacteria were identified. Consistent with
      prior data, these strains were host specific, with only one strain associated
      with members of the red oak family, one strain associated with American elm, one 
      strain associated with American sycamore, and two strains associated with
      mulberry. Strains found for asymptomatic foliage were the same as strains from
      the symptomatic foliage on individual trees. Cross transmission of the strains
      was not observed at sites with multiple species of infected trees within an
      approx. 25 m radius of one another. X. fastidiosa strain specificity observed for
      each genus of tree suggests a highly specialized host-pathogen relationship.

      7d, 7e, 7g, 7h, and 7i exhibited IC50 values of 32.3, 12.1, 15.7, 29.0, 16.0, and
      4.8 muM, respectively, with potency all higher than that of the control standard 
      acarbose (IC50=115.8 muM). Molecular docking studies revealed the existence of
      potential hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction between the enzyme and the
      active compound 7i.

AB  - Stable hydrogen and carbon isotope ratios of methoxyl groups (delta(2)Hmethoxyl
      and delta(13)Cmethoxyl values, respectively) in plant material have been shown to
      possess characteristic signatures. These isotopic signatures can be used for a
      variety of applications such as constraining the geographical origin and
      authenticity of biomaterials. Recently, it has also been suggested that
      delta(2)Hmethoxyl values of sedimentary organic matter of geological archives
      might serve as a palaeoclimate/-hydrology proxy. However, deposited organic
      matter is subject to both biotic and abiotic degradation processes, and therefore
      an evaluation of their potential impact on the delta(2)Hmethoxyl and
      delta(13)Cmethoxyl values would allow more reliable interpretations of both
      isotopic signatures. Here, we investigated this potential influence by exposing
      foliar litter of five different tree species (Sycamore maple, Mountain ash,
      European beech, Norway spruce and Scots pine) to natural degradation. The foliar 
      litter was sampled at nine intervals over a 27-month period, and the bulk
      methoxyl content as well as the delta(2)Hmethoxyl and delta(13)Cmethoxyl values
      were measured. At the end of the experiment, a loss of the bulk methoxyl in the
      range of approximately 40-70% was measured. Linear regression analysis showed no 
      dependence of delta(2)Hmethoxyl values with methoxyl content for four out of five
      foliar litter samples studied (R(2) in the range of 0.03 and 0.36, p > .05). On
      the contrary, the delta(13)Cmethoxyl values showed significant linear
      correlations for the great majority of the foliar litter samples (R(2) in the
      range of 0.51 and 0.73, p < .05). The litter species with the greatest methoxyl
      loss (Mountain ash, Scots pine and Norway spruce) showed the strongest (13)C
      enrichment, by up to approximately 5 per thousand. Since delta(2)Hmethoxyl shows 
      no systematic overall change during the course of degradation, we propose that
      there is considerable potential for its use as a palaeoclimate proxy for a wide
      range of geological archives containing, for instance, fossil wood or sedimentary
      organic matter. Care would need to be taken if delta(13)Cmethoxyl values of
      degraded organic matter are used for palaeoclimate/-environmental investigations.

TI  - Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in defense/stress responses activated by
      chitosan in sycamore cultured cells.
PG  - 3019-34
LID - 10.3390/ijms16023019 [doi]
AB  - Chitosan (CHT) is a non-toxic and inexpensive compound obtained by deacetylation 
      of chitin, the main component of the exoskeleton of arthropods as well as of the 
      cell walls of many fungi. In agriculture CHT is used to control numerous diseases
      on various horticultural commodities but, although different mechanisms have been
      proposed, the exact mode of action of CHT is still unknown. In sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.) cultured cells, CHT induces a set of defense/stress responses 
      that includes production of H2O2 and nitric oxide (NO). We investigated the
      possible signaling role of these reactive molecules in some CHT-induced responses
      by means of inhibitors of production and/or scavengers. The results show that
      both reactive nitrogen and oxygen species are not only a mere symptom of stress
      conditions but are involved in the responses induced by CHT in sycamore cells. In
      particular, NO appears to be involved in a cell death form induced by CHT that
      shows apoptotic features like DNA fragmentation, increase in caspase-3-like
      activity and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrion. On the contrary,
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) appear involved in a cell death form induced by CHT
      that does not show these apoptotic features but presents increase in lipid
      peroxidation.

TI  - Sequencing of the mitochondrial genome of the avocado lace bug Pseudacysta
      perseae (Heteroptera, Tingidae) using a genome skimming approach.

AB  - Lace bugs (Tingidae) are a family of phytophagous heteropterans, some of which
      are important agricultural and forestry pests. They currently comprise around
      2500 species distributed worldwide, for which only one mitochondrial genome has
      been described so far. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome and the
      nuclear ribosomal gene segment of the avocado lace bug Pseudacysta perseae using 
      a genome skimming approach on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. Fifty-four
      additional heteropteran mitogenomes, including the one of the sycamore lace bug
      Corythucha ciliata, were retrieved to allow for comparisons and phylogenetic
      analyses. P. perseae mitochondrial genome was determined to be 15,850 bp long,
      and presented the typical organisation of insect mitogenomes. The phylogenetic
      analysis placed P. perseae as a sister to C. ciliata but did not confirm the
      monophyly of Miroidae including Tingidae. Our results contradicted widely
      accepted phylogenetic hypothesis, which highlights the limits of analyses based
      on mitochondrial data only. Shotgun sequencing approaches should provide
      substantial improvements in harmonizing mitochondrial and nuclear databases.

AB  - Four natural chalcones bearing prenyl or geranyl groups, i.e., bavachalcone (1a),
      xanthoangelol (1b), isobavachalcone (1c), and isoxanthoangelol (1d) were
      synthesized by using a regio-selective iodination and the Suzuki coupling
      reaction as key steps. The first total synthesis of isoxanthoangelol (1d) was
      achieved in 36% overall yield. A series of diprenylated and digeranylated
      chalcone analogs were also synthesized by alkylation, regio-selective iodination,
      aldol condensation, Suzuki coupling and [1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. The
      structures of the 11 new derivatives were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and
      HRMS. The anticancer activity of these new chalcone derivatives against human
      tumor cell line K562 were evaluated by MTT assay in vitro. SAR studies suggested 
      that the 5'-prenylation/geranylation of the chalcones significantly enhance their
      cytotoxic activity. Among them, Bavachalcone (1a) displayed the most potent
      cytotoxic activity against K562 with IC50 value of 2.7 muM. The morphology
      changes and annexin-V/PI staining studies suggested that those chalcone
      derivatives inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells by inducing apoptosis.

AB  - Hypoglycin A (HGA) is the toxic principle in ackee (Blighia sapida Koenig), a
      nutritious and readily available fruit which is a staple of the Jamaican
      working-class and rural population. The aril of the unripe fruit has high
      concentrations of HGA, the cause of Jamaican vomiting sickness, which is very
      often fatal. HGA is also present in the samara of several species of maple (Acer 
      spp.) which are suspected to cause seasonal pasture myopathy in North America and
      equine atypical myopathy in Europe, often fatal for horses. The aim of this study
      was to develop a method for quantifying HGA in blood that would be sensitive
      enough to provide toxicological evidence of ackee or maple poisoning. Analysis
      was carried out using solid-phase extraction (HILIC cartridges), dansyl
      derivatization and UHPLC-HRMS/MS detection. The method was validated in whole
      blood with a detection limit of 0.35 mug/L (range: 0.8-500 mug/L). This is the
      first method applicable in forensic toxicology for quantifying HGA in whole
      blood. HGA was quantified in two serum samples from horses suffering from
      atypical myopathy. The concentrations were 446.9 and 87.8 mug/L. HGA was also
      quantified in dried arils of unripe ackee fruit (Suriname) and seeds of sycamore 
      maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) (France). The concentrations were 7.2 and 0.74
      mg/g respectively.

AB  - Under high temperature conditions, insects can tolerate to survive through
      various physiological mechanisms, which have been well documented in laboratory
      studies. However, it is still unclear as to whether these laboratory data can
      scale up to those in the field. Here we studied dynamics of heat-induced
      metabolites in Corythucha ciliata adults under both laboratory and field
      conditions to examine their significance in thermal tolerance of the species. We 
      compared the effects of controlled thermal treatments (2h at 33-43 degrees C at 2
      degrees C intervals in the laboratory) and naturally increasing thermal
      conditions (10:00-14:00 at 2-h intervals (33.5-37.2 degrees C) on a hot summer
      day in a field in Shanghai, China) on water content and levels of water-soluble
      protein, triglycerides, mannitol, and sorbitol in the adult bodies. The results
      showed that water content significantly decreased and all other metabolic
      parameters significantly increased in response to temperature stresses with
      similar patterns in both the laboratory and field, although the respective
      threshold temperatures were different under the two conditions. The close linkage
      observed in the two conditions suggests that a short period of heat stress
      induces water loss and accumulation of thermal metabolites in C. ciliata adults. 
      This heat-resistance provides a defense mechanism counteracting thermal damage in
      C. ciliata.

TI  - Interplay of Mg2+, ADP, and ATP in the cytosol and mitochondria: unravelling the 
      role of Mg2+ in cell respiration.
PG  - E4560-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1406251111 [doi]
AB  - In animal and plant cells, the ATP/ADP ratio and/or energy charge are generally
      considered key parameters regulating metabolism and respiration. The major
      alternative issue of whether the cytosolic and mitochondrial concentrations of
      ADP and ATP directly mediate cell respiration remains unclear, however. In
      addition, because only free nucleotides are exchanged by the mitochondrial
      ADP/ATP carrier, whereas MgADP is the substrate of ATP synthase (EC 3.6.3.14),
      the cytosolic and mitochondrial Mg(2+) concentrations must be considered as well.
      Here we developed in vivo/in vitro techniques using (31)P-NMR spectroscopy to
      simultaneously measure these key components in subcellular compartments. We show 
      that heterotrophic sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells incubated in various
      nutrient media contain low, stable cytosolic ADP and Mg(2+) concentrations,
      unlike ATP. ADP is mainly free in the cytosol, but complexed by Mg(2+) in the
      mitochondrial matrix, where [Mg(2+)] is tenfold higher. In contrast, owing to a
      much higher affinity for Mg(2+), ATP is mostly complexed by Mg(2+) in both
      compartments. Mg(2+) starvation used to alter cytosolic and mitochondrial
      [Mg(2+)] reversibly increases free nucleotide concentration in the cytosol and
      matrix, enhances ADP at the expense of ATP, decreases coupled respiration, and
      stops cell growth. We conclude that the cytosolic ADP concentration, and not ATP,
      ATP/ADP ratio, or energy charge, controls the respiration of plant cells. The
      Mg(2+) concentration, remarkably constant and low in the cytosol and tenfold
      higher in the matrix, mediates ADP/ATP exchange between the cytosol and matrix,
      [MgADP]-dependent mitochondrial ATP synthase activity, and cytosolic free ADP
      homeostasis.

AB  - Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NP) are one of the most abundantly utilized 
      nanoparticles in the world. Studies have demonstrated the ability of the anatase 
      crystal of TiO2 NP to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of
      ultraviolet radiation (UVR), a co-exposure likely to occur in aquatic ecosystems.
      The goal of this study was to examine the photo-induced toxicity of anatase TiO2 
      NP under natural sunlight to Daphnia magna. D. magna were exposed to a range of
      UVR intensities and anatase TiO2 concentrations in an outdoor exposure system
      using the sun as the source of UVR. Different UVR intensities were achieved using
      UVR opaque and transparent plastics. AnataseTiO2-NP demonstrated the reciprocal
      relationship seen in other phototoxic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic
      hydrocarbons (PAHs) at higher UVR treatments. The calculated 8h LC50 of anatase
      TiO2 NP was 139 ppb under full intensity ambient natural sunlight, 778 ppb under 
      50% natural sunlight, and >500 ppm under 10% natural sunlight. Mortality was also
      compared between animals allowed to accumulate a body burden of anatase TiO2 for 
      1h and organisms whose first exposure to anatase TiO2 aqueous suspensions
      occurred under UVR. A significantly greater toxic effect was observed in aqueous,
      low body burden suspensions than that of TiO2 1h body burdens, which is
      dissimilar from the model presented in PAHs. Anatase TiO2 presents a unique
      photo-induced toxic model that is different than that of established phototoxic
      compounds.

AB  - Magnetic resonance and ultrasound imaging have shown hamstring strain injuries
      occur most often in the biceps femoris long head (BFLH), and particularly in the 
      proximal vs. distal region of this muscle. Animal research and musculoskeletal
      modeling (MSK) have detected heterogeneous fascicle behavior within muscle
      regions, and within fascicles. Understanding architectural behavior differences
      during muscle contractions may help to discern possible mechanisms behind
      proximal BFLH injuries. The purpose of our study was to assess the magnitude of
      shortening of the proximal and distal fascicles of the BFLH under a range of
      muscle activation levels under isometric conditions using ultrasound imaging
      (US). Thirteen healthy adults performed targeted sustained isometric contractions
      while US were taken of the entire BFLH. Measurements of fascicle lengths in both 
      muscle regions were compared at 20%, 30%, 50%, and 67% MVIC. The results showed
      that while both regions shortened significantly with activation, the proximal
      fascicles were significantly longer, regardless of activation level (~38%), and
      shortened significantly more than the distal fascicles overall (~40%), and
      cumulatively at higher activation levels (30% and above). No significant strain
      differences were found between the two regions. These data suggest heterogeneous 
      fascicle behavior exists in an absolute sense; however, differences in behavior
      are eliminated when normalized (strain). Coupled with MSK literature, the absence
      of regional fascicle strain differences in this study may indicate strain
      heterogeneity is not detectable at the whole fascicle level. Further knowledge of
      this commonly strained muscle's regional behavior during dynamic movements could 
      provide evidence of proximal hamstring strain predisposition.

TI  - The effects of bt corn on rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) growth and

AB  - Bt crops are one of the most commonly used genetically modified crops worldwide. 
      Bt crops contain a gene that is derived from the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis,
      which produces the Cry1Ab toxin. Bt corn that contains the Cry1Ab toxin is used
      throughout the Midwest United States to control crop pests such as the European
      corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis). Headwater streams in regions known for intensive
      agriculture receive Bt corn detritus after the fall harvest, which is then
      consumed by a diverse community of stream invertebrates. The rusty crayfish
      (Orconectes rusticus) is a common invertebrate detritivore in these headwater
      streams. Both isogenic and Bt corn were grown under the controlled environmental 
      conditions of a greenhouse and, after senescence, were tested for nutritional
      equality. Rusty crayfish were exposed to one of several detrital treatments
      composed of Bt corn, Bt corn plus American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis),
      isogenic corn alone, isogenic corn plus P. occidentalis, or P. occidentalis alone
      for 8 weeks. Both strains of corn were grown under the controlled environmental
      conditions in a greenhouse and were tested for nutritional equality after
      senescence. Crayfish were housed in live streams with a water temperature of 12.8
      degrees C and a 12:12 h light-to-dark photoperiod. Survival and growth of animals
      within each experimental treatment were monitored each week. After 8 weeks of
      exposure, there was no statistically significant difference in growth between
      crayfish in Bt and isogenic treatments. However, survivorship was 31 % lower in
      the Bt treatment compared with the isogenic treatment. These results suggest that
      the Bt corn and isogenic corn were of equivalent nutritional value but that Bt
      corn does have a toxic effect on rusty crayfish during long-term exposure.

AB  - Incubation of Norway spruce with Physisporinus vitreus and sycamore with Xylaria 
      longipes results in reduction in density of these wood species that are
      traditionally used for the top and bottom plate of a violin, which follows by
      enhanced acoustic properties. We used Synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography, to
      study the three-dimensional structure of wood at the micro-scale level and the
      alterations of the density distribution after incubation with two white-rot
      fungi. Micro-tomography data from wood treated at different incubation periods
      are analyzed and compared with untreated (control) specimens to determine the
      wood density map and changes at the cell-wall level. Differences between the
      density of early- and latewood, xylem ray and around bordered pits in both Norway
      spruce and sycamore are studied. Three-dimensional hyphal networks of the
      P.vitreus and Xylaria longipes hyphae are visualized inside the cell lumina and
      their significance on the density of the early- and latewood cells after
      different incubation periods are discussed. The study illustrates the utility of 
      X-ray micro-tomography for both qualitative and quantitative studies of a wide
      variety of biological systems and due to its high sensitivity, small structural
      changes can be quantified.

TI  - Does melatonin have therapeutic use in tinnitus?
PG  - 362-6
LID - 10.14423/01.SMJ.0000450714.38550.d4 [doi]
AB  - Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, may be a promising treatment
      option for tinnitus. The primary functions of this hormone are believed to be the
      initiation and maintenance of sleep because its secretions coincide with
      circadian rhythms. Some investigators have noted that melatonin may alleviate
      subjective symptoms of tinnitus. Moreover, melatonin may have properties
      protective against ototoxic drugs such as amikacin, gentamicin, or cancer
      therapeutic agents that are dose dependent. In vitro, melatonin has demonstrated 
      antioxidative properties and it has been postulated that these antioxidative
      properties contribute to the alleviation of tinnitus. Melatonin levels used to
      obtain these findings in vitro, however, are at supraphysiologic levels;
      therefore, it is more likely that the benefits from taking supplemental melatonin
      occur from minimal antioxidative properties, sleep enhancement, or other
      potential methods of action that are not yet understood. Melatonin offers minimal
      risk of toxicity with modest daily doses such as 1 to 3 mg, as well as a low cost
      and favorable adverse effect profile for older adults. In addition to potential
      benefits in the treatment of tinnitus, melatonin also may have beneficial
      neurogenerative properties. We recommend that melatonin be considered for use in 
      patients with significant tinnitus.

AB  - We use homicide data and the International Crime Victimization Survey to examine 
      the role of firearms in explaining cross-national variation in violence. We
      suggest that while gun violence begets gun violence, it inhibits the tendency to 
      engage in violence without guns. We attribute the patterns to adversary
      effects-i.e., the tendency of offenders to take into account the threat posed by 
      their adversaries. Multi-level analyses of victimization data support the
      hypothesis that living in countries with high rates of gun violence lowers an
      individual's risk of an unarmed assault and assaults with less lethal weapons.
      Analyses of aggregate data show that homicide rates and gun violence rates load
      on a separate underlying factor than other types of violence. The results suggest
      that a country's homicide rate reflects, to a large extent, the tendency of its
      offenders to use firearms.

AB  - PURPOSE: Older adults have the highest incidence of new-onset epilepsy, yet there
      is a lack of self-management interventions to ensure that this population
      achieves desirable outcomes. In order to develop patient-centered interventions
      for older adults with epilepsy, self-management outcomes of importance to these
      patients must first be explored. The purpose of this study was to describe what
      outcomes older adults diagnosed with epilepsy late in life hope to achieve in
      self-managing their condition. METHOD: Qualitative description was used. 20 older
      adults took part in semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed using
      conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Six themes emerged - Maintaining
      Normalcy, We Want to be Involved, Well-Equipped, Seizure Freedom, Fitting
      Epilepsy in with Other Conditions, Incongruence with Provider Goals. CONCLUSION: 
      These results add to the extant literature, and provide knowledge on which
      patient-centered epilepsy self-management interventions can be developed. In
      addition, these results can inform the development of a patient-centered outcome 
      measure for older adults with epilepsy. Such a measure could be used in
      conjunction with existing measures related to disease status (seizure frequency, 
      etc.) to ensure that outcomes pertinent to both patients and providers are
      targeted and measured.

TI  - Comparison of urine and bladder or urethral mucosal biopsy culture obtained by
      transurethral cystoscopy in dogs with chronic lower urinary tract disease: 41
      cases (2002 to 2011).
PG  - 364-8
LID - 10.1111/jsap.12225 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare aerobic bacterial culture of urine to cystoscopically
      obtained mucosal biopsies of the lower urinary tract in dogs. METHODS:
      Retrospective review of case records from dogs that had transurethral cystoscopy 
      at a veterinary teaching hospital between 2002 and 2011. Dogs that had culture
      results from cystocentesis obtained urine and transurethral cystoscopically
      obtained mucosal samples were included in the study. Pathogens identified were
      compared between sampling methods. RESULTS: Forty dogs underwent transurethral
      cystoscopy for lower urinary tract disease on 41 occasions. There was significant
      (P = 0 . 0003) agreement between urine and mucosal biopsy cultures. Both cultures
      were negative in 66% and positive in 17% of dogs. There was a 17% disagreement
      between the sampling methods. Although not statistically significant, more
      mucosal samples than urine cultures were positive for Escherichia coli. CLINICAL 
      SIGNIFICANCE: There was a good agreement between pathogen identification from
      urine and lower urinary tract mucosal cultures. These results do not support the 
      utilisation of transurethral cystoscopy to obtain biopsy samples for culture in
      dogs with urinary tract infection and positive urine culture. Individual cases
      with possible chronic urinary tract infection and negative urine culture may
      benefit from transurethral cystoscopy to obtain biopsies for culture.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Young children in military families with a member who has a life
      changing injury can experience emotional difficulties and behavior changes.
      OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated a Sesame Workshop multimedia kit called: Talk,
      Listen, Connect: Changes (TLC-II(C); 2008). The kit, which included video and
      print materials, aimed to help caregivers (i.e., at-home partner, at-home
      relative or family member of a current or discharged military member) assist
      young children as they adjusted to their parent's injury. We expected that the
      materials would be used and their quality evaluated. We hypothesized that use of 
      the materials would produce improvements in caregiver and child outcomes as well 
      as reductions in perceptions of disruption in the home. We also predicted that
      kit-use would have a positive impact on the family. METHODS: One-hundred and
      fifty three families with children aged 2-8 years were randomly assigned to
      receive the kit being evaluated (TLC-II(C)) or a control kit (Healthy Habits for 
      Life (HHL)), also developed by Sesame Workshop. Group outcomes were compared four
      weeks following receipt of the kits using multivariate analysis of variance.
      RESULTS: All materials were well used and highly rated. All caregivers reported
      less social isolation, less child aggression, and significantly less disruptive
      home environments after kit use. Test group caregivers reported significantly
      greater reductions in depressive symptoms and significant increases in children's
      social competence over time in comparison to the control group. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results signal important improvements among families as a consequence of
      using either test or control materials. As a preventative intervention designed
      for families with an injured member, TLC-II(C) was particularly effective at
      improving coping.

      remains of Ezekiel Harper.

AB  - The 120-year-old skeletal remains of Confederate Civil War soldier Captain
      Ezekiel "Zeke" Harper were exhumed by court order in January 2011 for DNA
      analysis. The goal of the DNA testing was to support or refute whether Captain
      Harper had fathered a son (Earl J. Maxwell) with his Native American maid prior
      to his murder in 1892. Bones with adequate structural integrity (left tibia,
      right tibia, right femur, mandible, four teeth) were retrieved from the burial
      site and sent to the Institute of Applied Genetics in Fort Worth, Texas for
      analysis. Given the age and condition of the remains, three different extraction 
      methods were used to maximize the probability of DNA recovery. The majority of
      the DNA isolates from over fifty separate bone sections yielded partial autosomal
      STR genotypes and partial Y-STR haplotypes. After comparing the partial results
      for concordance, consensus profiles were generated for comparison to reference
      samples from alleged family members. Considering the genetic recombination that
      occurs in autosomal DNA over the generations within a family, Y-STR analysis was 
      determined to be the most appropriate and informative approach for determining
      potential kinship. Two of Earl J. Maxwell's grandsons submitted buccal samples
      for comparison. The Y-STR haplotypes obtained from both of these reference
      samples were identical to each other and to the alleles in Ezekiel Harper's
      consensus profile at all 17 loci examined. This Y-STR haplotype was not found in 
      either of two major Y-STR population databases (U.S. Y-STR database and YHRD).
      The fact that the Y-STR haplotype obtained from Ezekiel's skeletal remains and
      Earl's grandsons is not found in either population database demonstrates its
      rarity and further supports a paternal lineage relationship among them. Results
      of the genetic analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that Earl J. Maxwell
      is the son of Ezekiel Harper.

TI  - A randomised controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness, safety and
      cost-effectiveness of adalimumab in combination with methotrexate for the
      treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis (SYCAMORE Trial).
PG  - 14
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-15-14 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic
      disease in children. Children with JIA are at risk of inflammation of the uvea in
      the eye (uveitis). Overall, 20% to 25% of paediatric uveitis is associated with
      JIA. Major risk factors for development of uveitis in JIA are oligoarticular
      pattern of arthritis, an age at onset of arthritis of less than seven years of
      age, and antinuclear antibody positivity. In the initial stages of mild to
      moderate inflammation the uveitis is asymptomatic. This has led to current
      practice of screening all children with JIA for uveitis. Approximately 12% to 38%
      of patients with JIA develop uveitis in seven years following onset of arthritis.
      In 30% to 50% of children with JIA-associated uveitis structural complications
      are present at diagnosis. Furthermore about 50% to 75% of those with severe
      uveitis will eventually develop visual impairment secondary to ocular
      complications such as cataract and glaucoma. Defining the severity of
      inflammation and structural complications in uveitis patients is now possible
      following Standardised Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) guidelines, and modified to
      incorporate the consensus of end point and outcome criteria into the design of
      randomised trials. Despite current screening and therapeutic options
      (pre-biologics) 10% to 15% of children with JIA-associated uveitis may develop
      bilateral visual impairment and certified legally blind. To date, there remains
      no controlled trial evidence of benefits of biologic therapy. METHODS/DESIGN:
      This study will randomise 154 patients aged 2 to 18 years with active
      JIA-associated uveitis (despite methotrexate (MTX) treatment for at least 12
      weeks). All participants will be treated for 18 months, with follow up of 3 years
      from randomisation (continuing on MTX throughout). All participants will receive 
      a stable dose of MTX and in addition either adalimumab (20 mg/0.8 ml for
      patients<30 kg or 40 mg/0.8 ml for patients weighing 30 kg or more, subcutaneous 
      (s/c) injection every 2 weeks based on body weight), or placebo (0.8 ml as
      appropriate according to body weight) s/c injection every 2 weeks. DISCUSSION:
      This is the first randomised controlled trial that will assess the clinical
      effectiveness, safety and cost effectiveness of adalimumab in combination with
      methotrexate for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated
      uveitis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN10065623.

TI  - Competition for nitrogen between European beech and sycamore maple shifts in
      favour of beech with decreasing light availability.
PG  - 49-60
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpt112 [doi]
AB  - Plant species use different strategies for maximizing growth and fitness under
      changing environmental conditions. At the ecosystem level, seedlings in
      particular compete with other vegetation components for light and nitrogen (N),
      which often constitute growth-limiting resources. In this study, we investigated 
      the effect of light availability on the competition for N between seedlings of
      European beech and sycamore maple and analysed the consequences of this
      competition for the composition of N metabolites in fine roots. Our results show 
      different strategies in N acquisition between beech and sycamore maple. Both
      species responded to reduced light availability by adapting their morphological
      and physiological traits with a decrease in biomass and net assimilation rate and
      an increase in specific leaf area and leaf area ratio. For beech seedlings,
      competition with sycamore maple led to a reduction in organic N uptake capacity. 
      Reduced light availability led to a decrease in ammonium, but an increase in
      glutamine-N uptake capacity in sycamore maple. However, this response was
      stronger compared with that of beech and was accompanied by reduced growth. Thus,
      our results suggest better adaptation of N acquisition to reduced light
      availability in beech compared with sycamore maple seedlings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Measures of central pain processing like conditioned pain modulation 
      and suprathreshold heat pain response (SHPR) have been described to assess
      different components of central pain modulatory mechanisms. Central pain
      processing potentially plays a role in the development of postsurgical pain,
      however, the role of conditioned pain modulation and SHPR in explaining
      postoperative clinical pain and disability is still unclear. METHODS:
      Seventy-eight patients with clinical shoulder pain were included in this study.
      Patients were examined before shoulder surgery, at 3 months, and 6 months after
      surgery. The primary outcome measures were pain intensity and upper extremity
      disability. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that the change score (baseline- 3 mo) of 
      fifth pain rating of SHPR accounted for a significant amount of variance in
      6-month postsurgical clinical pain intensity and disability after age, sex,
      preoperative pain intensity, and relevant psychological factors were considered. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that baseline measures of central pain
      processing were not predictive of 6-month postoperative pain outcome. Instead,
      the 3-month change in SHPR might be a relevant factor in the transition to an
      elevated 6-month postoperative pain and disability outcomes. In patients with
      shoulder pain, the 3-month change in a measure of central pain processing might
      be a relevant factor in the transition to elevated 6-month postoperative pain and
      disability scores.

AB  - The complete mitochondrial genome of the sycamore lace bug, Corythucha ciliata,
      was sequenced in this study. It represents the first sequenced mitogenome of
      family Tingidae in Heteroptera. The mitogenome of C. ciliata is 15,257bp and
      contains 37 genes including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, two
      rRNA genes and a large non-coding region. Gene arrangement, nucleotide content,
      codon usage, and amino acid composition and asymmetry indicate a high degree of
      conservation with six other species of Cimicomorpha. The 13 PCGs initiated with
      ATN as the start codon and terminated with TAA, TA or T as stop codon. The
      evolutionary rate of each PCG was different, among which ATP8 showed the highest 
      rate while ATP6 indicated the lowest rate. The 22 tRNAs genes apparently fold
      into a typical cloverleaf structure; however, the anticodon (TTC) of trnSer (AGN)
      differs from other Heteropteran insects. Secondary structure modeling of rRNA
      genes revealed similarity to other insects, except for two incomplete helices
      (H1648 and H2735) in lrRNA. The predicted secondary structure of lrRNA indicates 
      45 helices in six domains, whereas srRNA has 27 helices in three domains. Three
      potential stem-loops and two tandem repeats (-TCTAAT-) were identified in the
      A+T-rich region. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that C. ciliata is a sister
      group to other Heteroptera species based on analysis of the 13 PCGs.

AB  - The influence of physical and chemical properties of 20 species of imported wood 
      on degradation of the wood by termites under field conditions was studied. The
      wood species studied were: Sycamore maple, Acer pseudoplatanus L. (Sapindales:
      Sapindaceae) (from two countries), Camphor, Dryobalanops aromatic C.F.Gaertner
      (Malvales: Dipterocarpaceae), Beech, Fagus grandifolia Ehrhart (Fagales:
      Fagaceae), F. sylvatica L. (from two countries), Oak, Quercus robur L., Ash,
      Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl (Lamiales: Oleaceae), F. excelsior L., Padauk,
      Pterocarpus soyauxii Taubert (Fabales: Fabaceae), (from two countries), Jamba,
      Xylia dolabrifiormis Roxburgh, Shorea laevis Ridley (Malvales: Dipterocarpaceae),
      S. macoptera Dyer, S. robusta Roth, Teak, Tectona grandis L.f. (Lamiales:
      Lamiaceae) (from five countries), and rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis Muller
      Argoviensis (Malpighiales: Euphorbiaceae) from India. The termites present were: 
      Odontotermes horni (Wasmann) (Isoptera: Termitidae), O. feae, O. wallonensis, and
      O. obeus (Rambur). A significant conelation was found between density, cellulose,
      lignin, and total phenolic contents of the wood and degradation by termites. The 
      higher the density of the wood, the lower the degradation. Similarly, higher
      amount of lignin and total phenolic contents ensured higher resistance, whereas
      cellulose drives the termites towards the wood.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine prevalence of modifiable risk factors and their
      contribution to patient quality of life (QoL) as rated by dementia patients and
      family caregivers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Home environment.
      PARTICIPANTS: 88 patients and their caregivers. MEASUREMENTS: Modifiable
      characteristics of home environments, patients, and caregivers were observed or
      obtained through interview. Demographics and ratings of patients' QoL were
      obtained from patients and caregivers. RESULTS: Patients had mean Mini-mental
      Status Examination (MMSE) score = 17.7 +/- 4.6, (range: 10-28) on an average 7.7 
      +/- 2.4 neuropsychiatric behaviors, 6.0 +/- 3.1 health conditions and moderate
      functional challenges; 70.7% (N = 58) had fall risk; 60.5% (N = 52) had sleep
      problems at least once weekly; and 42.5% (N = 37) had pain. An average of 8.1 +/-
      5.2 home hazards and 5.4 +/- 4.1 adaptations were observed; 51.7% had unmet
      device/navigation needs. Patients' and caregivers' QoL ratings were unrelated to 
      MMSE; and patients' self-rated QoL was higher than rated by caregivers. Number of
      health conditions and unmet device/navigation needs were inversely associated
      with patient self-rated QoL, and number of health conditions, frequency of
      behaviors, and level of negative communications were inversely associated with
      caregiver's assessment of patient QoL. Positive endorsement of caregiving was
      positively associated with caregiver's appraisal of patient QoL. Other factors
      were unrelated. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients lived at home with high fall risk,
      unmanaged behavioral symptoms, pain, sleep disturbances, environmental
      challenges, and multiple hazards. Except for health, factors associated with
      lower QoL differed for patients and caregivers. Results suggest need to improve
      QoL by addressing modifiable risk factors and tailoring interventions to patient 
      and caregiver perspectives.

AB  - The closure of swine farms requires decommissioning of lagoons that contain large
      amounts of swine solids (sludge). Sludge is typically transported and land
      applied to soils. However, in some cases this process could be economically
      prohibitive and/or unpractical. An alternative idea is to encase sludge with
      lagoon soil berms after removing overlying effluent, followed by establishment of
      forages or short-rotation woody crops on the encased sludge. The objective of
      this study was to investigate growth potential for several forages and tree
      species into a pure layer of swine sludge. Alfalfa (Meticago sativa),
      bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), green ash
      (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), and sycamore
      (Platanus occidentalis) were established in 40 cm deep pots consisting of a
      lagoon berm soil overlaying a sludge layer for 12 w followed by analysis of
      aboveground and belowground biomass production. "New" and "old" sludge was
      collected from an active 10 year old lagoon and decommissioned 50 year old
      lagoon, respectively. A control (soil only) was used. Encased sludge treatments
      increased forage biomass production. Sycamore and green ash were sensitive to new
      sludge but not old sludge as these species had less biomass production in new
      sludge than control and showed tissue trace nutrient deficiencies. While both
      sludge materials contained adequate nutrients, the new sludge had a salt
      concentration 1.8 times higher than old sludge as indicated by electrical
      conductivity (12.4 mS). Thus, the forage crops and black locust were able to

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although rarer than its adult counterpart, non-infectious uveitis
      remains a significant cause of ocular morbidity in children. Owing to the
      chronicity of the disorder and when refractory to first-line treatment, namely
      corticosteroids, systemic immunosuppressive treatment may be required to control 
      the disease. AREAS COVERED: Following a literature search using the keywords
      'paediatric uveitis', 'juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis',
      'immunosuppression' and 'treatment', we reviewed the range and effectiveness of
      treatments employed in the management of non-infectious, paediatric uveitis.
      EXPERT OPINION: Corticosteroids (topical, periocular, intraocular or systemic)
      remain the initial drug of choice in ameliorating the signs and symptoms of
      non-infectious paediatric uveitis. Failure to control the disease and/or failure 
      to reduce the oral dose of prednisolone at least 0.15 mg/kg within 4 weeks often 
      requires additional immunosuppressant therapy. Methotrexate and azathioprine have
      shown to be effective in the management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis
      (JIA)-associated uveitis with the former considered the first-line
      corticosteroid-sparing agent. Biologic therapies are increasingly used earlier in
      the disease with investigators in the UK currently recruiting patients for the
      SYCAMORE trial evaluating the efficacy of methotrexate and adalimumab vs
      methotrexate alone for the treatment for JIA-associated uveitis. Until further
      randomised controlled trials are conducted, the use of other biologic agents
      should only be used with an appreciation that there are potentially unknown
      side-effects and that there is not a full knowledge of their efficacy.

AB  - The retrofitting of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) such as permeable
      pavements is currently undertaken ad hoc using expert experience supported by
      minimal guidance based predominantly on hard engineering variables. There is a
      lack of practical decision support tools useful for a rapid assessment of the
      potential of ecosystem services when retrofitting permeable pavements in urban
      areas that either feature existing trees or should be planted with trees in the
      near future. Thus the aim of this paper is to develop an innovative rapid
      decision support tool based on novel ecosystem service variables for retrofitting
      of permeable pavement systems close to trees. This unique tool proposes the
      retrofitting of permeable pavements that obtained the highest ecosystem service
      score for a specific urban site enhanced by the presence of trees. This approach 
      is based on a novel ecosystem service philosophy adapted to permeable pavements
      rather than on traditional engineering judgement associated with variables based 
      on quick community and environment assessments. For an example case study area
      such as Greater Manchester, which was dominated by Sycamore and Common Lime, a
      comparison with the traditional approach of determining community and environment
      variables indicates that permeable pavements are generally a preferred SuDS
      option. Permeable pavements combined with urban trees received relatively high
      scores, because of their great potential impact in terms of water and air quality
      improvement, and flood control, respectively. The outcomes of this paper are
      likely to lead to more combined permeable pavement and tree systems in the urban 
      landscape, which are beneficial for humans and the environment.

TI  - ED redesign improves patient flow, satisfaction.
PG  - 53-4
AB  - Sycamore Medical Center's Lean project to improve patient flow in the emergency
      department resulted in an increase in patient satisfaction scores and a decrease 
      in patients who left without being seen. A multidisciplinary team analyzed how
      patients arrive, how they are treated, and how they are triaged. The team
      examined the work of all emergency department staff and made changes to optimize 
      their time. The team created a set of essential care orders the hospital can use 
      if the patient is stable and can go to the floor.

TI  - The zebrafish reference genome sequence and its relationship to the human genome.
PG  - 498-503
LID - 10.1038/nature12111 [doi]
AB  - Zebrafish have become a popular organism for the study of vertebrate gene
      function. The virtually transparent embryos of this species, and the ability to
      accelerate genetic studies by gene knockdown or overexpression, have led to the
      widespread use of zebrafish in the detailed investigation of vertebrate gene
      function and increasingly, the study of human genetic disease. However, for
      effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the
      extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structures are related to orthologous
      human genes. To examine this, we generated a high-quality sequence assembly of
      the zebrafish genome, made up of an overlapping set of completely sequenced
      large-insert clones that were ordered and oriented using a high-resolution
      high-density meiotic map. Detailed automatic and manual annotation provides
      evidence of more than 26,000 protein-coding genes, the largest gene set of any
      vertebrate so far sequenced. Comparison to the human reference genome shows that 
      approximately 70% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. 
      In addition, the high quality of this genome assembly provides a clearer
      understanding of key genomic features such as a unique repeat content, a scarcity
      of pseudogenes, an enrichment of zebrafish-specific genes on chromosome 4 and
      chromosomal regions that influence sex determination.

TI  - New perspectives on molecular targeted therapy in ovarian clear cell carcinoma.
PG  - 1553-9
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2013.126 [doi]
AB  - Ovarian clear cell carcinomas (OCCCs) account for about 5-13% of all epithelial
      ovarian carcinomas in Western populations. It is characterised by resistance to
      conventional platinum-based chemotherapy, and new therapeutic strategies are
      urgently required. This article will focus on how recent discoveries have
      enhanced our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of OCCCs, leading to new
      therapeutic opportunities. These include mutations in ARID1A, which provides a
      link to endometriosis, upregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT
      pathway, particularly through mutations of PIK3CA and inactivation of PTEN, and
      increased activity of pathways involved in angiogenesis. Targeting HER2,
      apoptotic escape mechanisms and mismatch repair defects offer additional
      opportunities for treating this enigmatic tumour subtype.

TI  - The effect of poverty and social protection on national homicide rates: Direct
      and moderating effects.

AB  - Social protection is the ability of a government to insulate its citizens from
      the problems associated with poverty and market forces that negatively affect
      their quality of life. Prior research shows that government policies that provide
      social protection moderate the influence of inequality on national homicide
      rates. Recent research, however, reveals a strong association between poverty and
      national homicide rates. Further, theory and evidence suggest that social
      protection policies are meant to aid in providing a subsistence level of living, 
      and thus to alleviate the vagaries of poverty not inequality. To this point,
      however, no studies have examined the potentially moderating effect of social
      protection on the strength of the association between poverty and homicide rates 
      cross-nationally. We do so in the present study. Employing data for the year 2004
      from a sample of 30 nations, we estimate a series of weighted least squares
      regression models to test three hypotheses: the association between poverty and
      homicide will remain significant and positive when controlling for social
      protection, social protection will have a significant negative direct effect on
      national homicide rates, and social protection will diminish the strength of the 
      poverty-homicide association. The results provided evidence supporting all three 
      hypotheses. We situate our findings in the cross-national empirical literature on
      social structure and homicide and discuss our results in the theoretical context 
      of social protection.

AB  - In this study, the subject of heavy metal concentration in soil, rock, sediment, 
      surface water and groundwater, which can be caused by natural or man-posed
      pollution, was analyzed in the industrial park of Rasht. These concentrations
      were compared with the standard range of environmental data. Heavy metals are
      important environmental pollutants that can cause health hazards to humans,
      plants and microorganisms by entering food chain. This study aimed to investigate
      the absorption of lead by the leaves of sycamore tree species in the industrial
      park of Rasht. For this purpose, a sample of 32 sycamore tree species were
      randomly selected at a specified time, and the concentration of lead were
      measured using an atomic absorption device. Results showed that the amount of
      lead absorption by sycamore leaves is remarkable. The highest amount of lead
      absorption by sycamore leaves was detected at station 1 (Khazar Steel) and the
      lowest amount at station 2 (control station).

AB  - Important heavy metals such as lead and cadmium are part of the pollutants
      produced by cars and are spread in the urban environment by traffic flow. In
      order to study the amount of contamination in the trees along the streets and to 
      determine the traffic parameters that affect the lead content in sycamore leaves 
      in Rasht, four stations on the margins of the city streets were selected for this
      case study in terms of traffic volume (low or high). Traffic parameters including
      three high-traffic stations considering daily and monthly traffic volumes and one
      low-traffic station were selected. First, 32 sycamore bases were randomly chosen 
      at the intervals of 10-15 m from the whole range of tree canopy in order to
      determine the absorption of lead; and then, 20 g of each sample were tested to
      determine the amount of lead absorption. The results of this study, on the amount
      of lead absorption by the sycamore tree species at three high-traffic and one
      control station, showed that Takhti station had the highest amount of lead
      absorption (37.19 ppm) compared with other three stations. Therefore, the
      sycamore tree species can be an appropriate one for the margins of urban streets.

PG  - 11-8
LID - 10.3928/21650799-20121217-28 [doi]
AB  - Errors in assumptions and business practices that limit the success of a nurse
      consultant, and ways to avoid them, are described. Enthusiasm and dedication must
      be accompanied by a realistic understanding of the time commitment, financial
      resources, and objective decision making necessary to succeed. The nurse
      consultant must be able to identify potential client needs and promote services
      effectively to a target market. Improper pricing with undervalued services must
      be avoided. Even with a large client base, poor cash flow management, inadequate 
      legal precautions, and lack of contingency planning are critical concerns. The
      pros and cons of various business forms, such as partnerships, are explored.
      Independent consulting can be satisfying and profitable with proper understanding
      of the pitfalls and how to avoid them.

      feasibility trial.
PG  - 1485-91
LID - 10.1002/pon.3194 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate Problem-Focussed Interactive Telephone
      Therapy, an individual psychological therapy based on cognitive-behavioural
      therapy adapted for telephone delivery to cancer patients with high psychological
      needs. METHODS: A non-randomised, within-group prospective design was used.
      Outcome measures pre-therapy and post-therapy included were as follows: Hospital 
      Anxiety and Depression Scale, Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale:
      helpless/hopeless sub-scale only, Checklist of Cancer Concerns, Cancer Coping
      Questionnaire and EQ-5D quality of life. A study-specific Service Evaluation
      Questionnaire was included. Eligible patients were either (i) offered out-patient
      screening for anxiety/depression/helplessness (n=649) or (ii) referred for
      psychological care by oncology clinicians (n=160). RESULTS: Thirty two percent
      (36/114) of screen-identified cases and 22% (35/160) of referred patients
      participated, and 42 were available for analysis. There were significant
      post-therapy improvements in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety
      (p=0.002) and depression (p=0.003), Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale
      helpless/hopeless (p=0.036), cancer concerns (p=0.005) and overall quality of
      life (p=0.048). Overall, 81% (34/42) of participants were defined as clinical
      cases at baseline and 32% were no longer cases post-therapy. There were
      significant improvements in coping consistent with the therapy method.
      CONCLUSIONS: A minority of symptomatic patients opt for telephone psychological
      therapy; however, where they do, there are significant improvements indicating
      that telephone-delivered therapy is feasible in patients with high needs.
      Findings are discussed in relation to current issues on the implementation of
      distress screening and psychological therapy provision within clinical settings.

PG  - 356-66
LID - 10.1007/s10728-012-0227-y [doi]
AB  - The aim of this paper is to scrutinize a contemporary standoff in the American
      debate over the moral permissibility of human reproductive cloning in its
      prospective use as a eugenic enhancement technology. I shall argue that there is 
      some significant and under-appreciated common ground between the defenders and
      opponents of human cloning. Champions of the moral and legal permissibility of
      cloning support the technology based on the right to procreative liberty provided
      it were to become as safe as in vitro fertilization and that it be used only by
      adults who seek to rear their clone children. However, even champions of
      procreative liberty oppose the commodification of cloned embryos, and, by
      extension, the resulting commodification of the cloned children who would be
      produced via such embryos. I suggest that a Kantian moral argument against the
      use of cloning as an enhancement technology can be shown to be already implicitly
      accepted to some extent by champions of procreative liberty on the matter of
      commodification of cloned embryos. It is in this argument against commodification
      that the most vocal critics of cloning such as Leon Kass and defenders of cloning
      such as John Robertson can find greater common ground. Thus, I endeavor to
      advance the debate by revealing a greater degree of moral agreement on some
      fundamental premises than hitherto recognized.

TI  - A phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of CHR-3996, an oral class I 
      selective histone deacetylase inhibitor in refractory solid tumors.

AB  - PURPOSE: This clinical trial investigated the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of CHR-3996, a selective
      class I histone deacetylase inhibitor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CHR-3996 was
      administered orally once a day. This phase I trial used a 3+3 dose-escalation
      design. PK profiles were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectroscopic methods and PD studies were conducted using ELISA studying histone 
      H3 acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Thirty-nine
      patients were treated at dose levels of 5 mg (n = 3), 10 mg (n = 4), 20 mg (n =
      3), 40 mg (n = 10), 80 mg (n = 10), 120 mg (n = 4), and 160 mg (n = 5)
      administered orally once daily. The dose-limiting toxicities seen were
      thrombocytopenia (160 mg), fatigue (80 and 120 mg), plasma creatinine elevation
      (80 and 120 mg), and atrial fibrillation (40 mg). The area under the curve was
      proportional to the administered dose and a maximal plasma concentration of 259
      ng/mL at a dose of 40 mg exceeded the concentrations required for antitumor
      efficacy in preclinical models. Target inhibition measured by quantification of
      histone acetylation was shown at doses of 10 mg/d and was maximal at 40 mg. A
      partial response was seen in one patient with metastatic acinar pancreatic
      carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Taking the toxicity and PK/PD profile into consideration,
      the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is 40 mg/d. At this dose, CHR-3996 has a
      favorable toxicologic, PK, and PD profile. CHR-3996 has shown preliminary
      clinical activity and should be evaluated in further clinical trials.

PG  - 170-8

AB  - Up to 40% of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer develop metastatic
      disease that generally responds to initial chemical or surgical castration, but
      this eventually progresses despite castrate levels of testosterone, termed
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). A large phase 3 trial of abiraterone
      acetate in patients who have progressed following docetaxel based chemotherapy
      were published in 2011 and dramatically proved that CRPC is still
      androgen-dependant and responds to CYP17 inhibition. Overall survival benefits
      were also reported for a novel tubulin-binding drug, cabazitaxel, tested as
      second-line chemotherapy after docetaxel failure; for sipuleucel-T, an autologous
      dendritic cell therapy, in chemotherapy-naive patients; for MDV3100, a novel
      antiandrogen, and for radium-223, which is a bone-seeking
      alpha-irradiation-emitting radioisotope. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against
      receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand, was shown to be superior to
      zoledronic acid for prevention of skeletal-related events in prostate cancer
      patients with metastatic bone disease. This review will focus on the recent
      developments in the field of CRPC.

TI  - A simple and efficient method for the long-term preservation of plant cell
      suspension cultures.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/1746-4811-8-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The repeated weekly subculture of plant cell suspension is labour
      intensive and increases the risk of variation from parental cells lines. Most of 
      the procedures to preserve cultures are based on controlled freezing/thawing and 
      storage in liquid nitrogen. However, cells viability after unfreezing is
      uncertain. The long-term storage and regeneration of plant cell cultures remains 
      a priority. RESULTS: Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and Arabidopsis cell were
      preserved over six months as suspensions cultures in a phosphate-free nutrient
      medium at 5 degrees C. The cell recovery monitored via gas exchange measurements 
      and metabolic profiling using in vitro and in vivo 13C- and 31P-NMR took a couple
      of hours, and cell growth restarted without appreciable delay. No measurable cell
      death was observed. CONCLUSION: We provide a simple method to preserve
      physiologically homogenous plant cell cultures without subculture over several
      months. The protocol based on the blockage of cell growth and low culture
      temperature is robust for heterotrophic and semi-autotrophic cells and should be 
      adjustable to cell lines other than those utilised in this study. It requires no 
      specialized equipment and is suitable for routine laboratory use.

      deciduous woodland.
PG  - e29616
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0029616 [doi]
AB  - British temperate broadleaf woodlands have been widely fragmented since the
      advent of modern agriculture and development. As a result, a higher proportion of
      woodland area is now subject to edge effects which can alter the efficiency of
      ecosystem functions. These areas are particularly sensitive to drought.
      Decomposition of detritus and nutrient cycling are driven by soil microbe and
      fauna coactivity. The bait lamina assay was used to assess soil fauna trophic
      activity in the upper soil horizons at five sites in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire:
      two edge, two intermediate and one core site. Faunal trophic activity was highest
      in the core of the woodland, and lowest at the edge, which was correlated with a 
      decreasing soil moisture gradient. The efficiency of the assay was tested using
      four different bait flavours: standardised, ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), oak
      (Quercus robur L.), and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.). The standardised bait 
      proved the most efficient flavour in terms of feeding activity. This study
      suggests that decomposition and nutrient cycling may be compromised in many of
      the UK's small, fragmented woodlands in the event of drought or climate change.

TI  - The relationship between borderline personality disorder and number of sexual
      partners.
PG  - 782-8
LID - 10.1521/pedi.2011.25.6.782 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we examined the number of self-reported lifetime sexual partners
      between those with and without borderline personality disorder (BPD). Our
      hypothesis was that, due to the nature of the disorder, those with BPD would
      exhibit a greater number of lifetime sexual partners. Using a survey methodology 
      in a consecutive sample of internal medicine outpatients (N = 354), we
      administered two self-report measures for BPD (the borderline personality scale
      of the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4 and the Self-Harm Inventory), and
      queried participants, "How many sexual partners have you had in your lifetime?"
      Correlation coefficients and one-way ANOVAs were conducted to determine the
      relationship between BPD and the number of sexual partners. According to BPD
      status with the borderline personality scale of the Personality Diagnostic
      Questionnaire-4, we found that the mean number of sexual partners among
      BPD-positive participants was nearly double (p < .001) that of BPD-negative
      participants; according to BPD status with the Self-Harm Inventory, the mean
      number of sexual partners among BPD-positive participants was more than double (p
      < .001) that of BPD-negative participants. Compared to internal medicine
      outpatients without BPD, those with BPD exhibit a statistically significantly
      greater number of sexual partners.

TI  - Five forms of childhood trauma: relationships with aggressive behavior in
      adulthood.
LID - 10.4088/PCC.12m01353 [doi]
LID - PCC.12m01353 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine relationships between 5 types of childhood trauma
      (witnessing violence, physical neglect, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and
      sexual abuse) and an aggression score based on 21 self-reported aggressive
      behaviors in adulthood. METHOD: Using a cross-sectional design and a self-report 
      survey methodology, we examined relationships between 5 types of childhood trauma
      and the number of aggressive behaviors engaged in during adulthood in a
      consecutive sample of 342 internal medicine outpatients at Sycamore Primary Care 
      Center, Kettering, Ohio, during October 2011. The primary outcome measure was the
      score on the Aggressive Behavior Questionnaire. RESULTS: In univariate analyses, 
      each childhood trauma variable demonstrated a statistically significant
      relationship with the number of aggressive behaviors endorsed (P < .001). In
      addition, there was a linear relationship between the number of different forms
      of childhood trauma and the number of aggressive behaviors endorsed. In
      multivariate analyses, only 2 childhood trauma variables remained independently
      predictive: witnessing violence (P < .001) and emotional abuse (P < .05).
      CONCLUSIONS: There appear to be indistinct relationships between trauma in
      childhood and aggression/violence in adulthood. In this sample of primary care
      patients, witnessing violence and experiencing emotional abuse were particularly 
      relevant variables associated with the number of aggressive behaviors in
      adulthood.

TI  - Phase II, open-label, randomized, multicenter study comparing the efficacy and
      safety of olaparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, and pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin in patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and recurrent
      ovarian cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE: Olaparib (AZD2281), an orally active poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
      inhibitor that induces synthetic lethality in BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient cells,
      has shown promising clinical efficacy in nonrandomized phase II trials in
      patients with ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deficiency. We assessed the
      comparative efficacy and safety of olaparib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
      (PLD) in this patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter,
      open-label, randomized, phase II study, patients with ovarian cancer that
      recurred within 12 months of prior platinum therapy and with confirmed germline
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were enrolled. Patients were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio
      to olaparib 200 mg twice per day or 400 mg twice per day continuously or PLD 50
      mg/m(2) intravenously every 28 days. The primary efficacy end point was Response 
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) -assessed progression-free survival 
      (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR) and safety.
      RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were randomly assigned. Median PFS was 6.5 months 
      (95% CI, 5.5 to 10.1 months), 8.8 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 9.2 months), and 7.1
      months (95% CI, 3.7 to 10.7 months) for the olaparib 200 mg, olaparib 400 mg, and
      PLD groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in
      PFS (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.56; P = .66) for combined olaparib
      doses versus PLD. RECIST-assessed ORRs were 25%, 31%, and 18% for olaparib 200
      mg, olaparib 400 mg, and PLD, respectively; differences were not statistically
      significant. Tolerability of both treatments was as expected based on previous
      trials. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of olaparib was consistent with previous
      studies. However, the efficacy of PLD was greater than expected. Olaparib 400 mg 
      twice per day is a suitable dose to explore in further studies in this patient
      population.

AB  - Although adult sycamore lace bugs Corythucha ciliata (Say) show no sign of
      aggregation, nymphs at all developing stages are gregarious. When an individual
      nymph in the center of a colony was squashed with a needlepoint, proximate nymphs
      showed evasive behavior. The same evasive reaction was produced by exposing
      aggregated nymphs to nymph hexane extract. The active component,
      E-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ol, geraniol, was responsible for the evasive
      behavior, and identified as the alarm pheromone. One nanogram of the alarm
      pheromone elicited activity similar to that in a third instar nymph. Presence of 
      2-acylcyclohexane-1,3-diones and their 4-hydroxy analogues are reconfirmed as
      nymph-specific components, though their biological significance remains unknown.

TI  - Rapid cold hardening increases cold and chilling tolerances more than acclimation
      in the adults of the sycamore lace bug, Corythucha ciliata (Say) (Hemiptera:
      Tingidae).
PG  - 1577-82
LID - 10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.08.012 [doi]
AB  - The sycamore lace bug, Corythucha ciliata is a new, invasive pest of Platanus
      trees in China. Although C. ciliata is often subjected to acute low temperatures 
      in early winter and spring in northern and eastern China, the cold tolerance of
      C. ciliata has not been well studied. The objectives of this study were to
      determine whether adults of C. ciliata are capable of rapid cold hardening (RCH),
      and to compare the benefits of RCH vs. cold acclimation (ACC) in the laboratory. 
      When the adult females incubated at 26 degrees C were transferred directly to the
      discriminating temperature (-12 degrees C) for 2 h, survival was only 22%.
      However, exposure to 0 degrees C for 4 h before transfer to -12 degrees C for 2 h
      induced RCH, i.e., increased survival to 68%. RCH could also be induced by
      gradual cooling of the insects at rates between 0.1 and 0.25 degrees C min(-1).
      The protection against cold shock obtained through RCH at 0 degrees C for 4 h was
      lost within 1h if the adults were returned to 26 degrees C before exposure to -12
      degrees C. Survival at both -12 and -5 degrees C was greater for RCH-treated than
      for ACC-treated adults (for ACC, adults were kept at 15 degrees C for 5 days),
      and the lethal temperature (2 h exposure) was lower for RCH-treated than for
      ACC-treated adults. The results suggest that RCH may help C. ciliata survive the 
      acute low temperatures that often occur in early winter and early spring in
      northern and eastern China.

PG  - 244-7
LID - 10.1080/00480169.2011.596181 [doi]
AB  - CASE HISTORY: A marked perineal swelling was identified in a 4-year-old entire
      nulliparous Huntaway bitch. The mass was first observed at last oestrus, 6 months
      previously. CLINICAL FINDINGS: A diffuse swelling was visible in the perineum
      that extended from the anus to the vulva. The vulval commisure was distorted
      ventrolaterally. An extraluminal mass involved the vulva, vestibule and vagina.
      On rectal and vaginal examination the rostral extent could not be identified.
      There was no palpable intraluminal mass. The bitch produced a reduced urine flow,
      and there was complete voiding of the bladder. The urethra was not involved.
      Vaginal cytology suggested pro-oestrus. PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Multiple
      fine-needle aspirates were non-diagnostic. Incisional biopsies revealed extensive
      well-differentiated fatty tissue with scattered bundles of collagen and
      occasional fascicles of smooth muscle. Following complete excisional biopsy the
      formalin-fixed neoplasm weighed 714 g and measured 13 x 11 x 6 cm.
      Histologically, there was a thin outer layer of fibrous tissue, surrounding
      sheets of mature adipocytes and randomly distributed bundles of smooth muscle.
      Immunohistochemical findings were consistent with a smooth muscle neoplasm
      possessing oestrogen receptors. DIAGNOSIS: The clinical, gross, histological and 
      immunohistochemical findings were consistent with a diagnosis of lipoleiomyoma
      expressing oestrogen receptors. CLINICAL RELAVANCE: A lipoleiomyoma should be
      considered a differential diagnosis for a benign tumour in the caudal
      reproductive tract of the bitch. Incisional and fine-needle aspiration biopsies
      of a lipoleiomyoma may resemble a lipoma. Excisional biopsy may be required for a
      definitive diagnosis. Lipoleiomyomas in the reproductive tract of the bitch may
      possess sex steroid receptors, and patients may benefit from ovariohysterectomy
      or hormonal therapies prior to excision.

LID - 10.1016/j.envpol.2011.05.017 [doi]
AB  - The Oak Ridge Reservation, established in 1942, was the designated site for the
      construction of the atomic bomb. During a 20-year period from 1944 to 1963
      radioactive and toxic chemical pollutants, especially mercury compounds were
      released into the surrounding waterways. Tree diversity and mycorrhizal presence 
      and abundance were analyzed in the mercury-contaminated floodplains of East Fork 
      Poplar Creek Oak Ridge (EFPC) (Tennessee). A subsequent greenhouse study was
      conducted to assess the phytotoxic effects of different mercuric solutions on
      Platanus occidentalis (American Sycamore), inoculated with soils from EFPC. Total
      soil mercury in the field had no effect on tree diversity. Organic species of
      mercury proved to be more toxic than inorganic species of mercury and soil
      inoculants from EFPC had no protective effects against Hg toxicity in our
      greenhouse study. Comparison of the effects of mercury contamination in our field
      and greenhouse studies was difficult due to uncontrolled factors.

TI  - A new conceptual model for the fate of lignin in decomposing plant litter.
PG  - 1052-62
AB  - Lignin is a main component of plant litter. Its degradation is thought to be
      critical for litter decomposition rates and the build-up of soil organic matter. 
      We studied the relationships between lignin degradation and the production of
      dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and of CO2 during litter decomposition. Needle or 
      leaf litter of five species (Norway spruce, Scots pine, mountain ash, European
      beech, sycamore maple) and of different decomposition stage (freshly fallen and
      up to 27 months of field exposure) was incubated in the laboratory for two years.
      Lignin degradation was followed with the CuO method. Strong lignin degradation
      occurred during the first 200 incubation days, as revealed by decreasing yields
      of lignin-derived phenols. Thereafter lignin degradation leveled off. This
      pattern was similar for fresh and decomposed litter, and it stands in contrast to
      the common view of limited lignin degradation in fresh litter. Dissolved organic 
      carbon and CO2 also peaked in the first period of the incubation but were not
      interrelated. In the later phase of incubation, CO2 production was positively
      correlated with DOC amounts, suggesting that bioavailable, soluble compounds
      became a limiting factor for CO2 production. Lignin degradation occurred only
      when CO2 production was high, and not limited by bioavailable carbon. Thus carbon
      availability was the most important control on lignin degradation. In turn,
      lignin degradation could not explain differences in DOC and CO2 production over
      the study period. Our results challenge the traditional view regarding the fate
      and role of lignin during litter decomposition. Lignin degradation is controlled 
      by the availability of easily decomposable carbon sources. Consequently, it
      occurs particularly in the initial phase of litter decomposition and is hampered 
      at later stages if easily decomposable resources decline.

TI  - Transpiration of urban forests in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.
PG  - 661-77
AB  - Despite its importance for urban planning, landscape management, and water
      management, there are very few in situ estimates of urban-forest transpiration.
      Because urban forests contain an unusual and diverse mix of species from many
      regions worldwide, we hypothesized that species composition would be a more
      important driver of spatial variability in urban-forest transpiration than
      meteorological variables in the Los Angeles (California, USA) region. We used
      constant-heat sap-flow sensors to monitor urban tree water use for 15 species at 
      six locations throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area. For many of these
      species no previous data on sap flux, water use, or water relations were
      available in the literature. To scale sap-flux measurements to whole trees we
      conducted a literature survey of radial trends in sap flux across multiple
      species and found consistent relationships for angiosperms vs. gymnosperms. We
      applied this relationship to our measurements and estimated whole-tree and
      plot-level transpiration at our sites. The results supported very large species
      differences in transpiration, with estimates ranging from 3.2 +/- 2.3 kg x
      tree(-1) x d(-1) in unirrigated Pinus canariensis (Canary Island pine) to 176.9
      +/- 75.2 kg x tree(-1) x d(-1) in Platanus hybrida (London planetree) in the
      month of August. Other species with high daily transpiration rates included Ficus
      microcarpa (laurel fig), Gleditsia triacanthos (honeylocust), and Platanus
      racemosa (California sycamore). Despite irrigation and relatively large tree
      size, Brachychiton populneas (kurrajong), B. discolor (lacebark), Sequoia
      sempervirens (redwood), and Eucalyptus grandis (grand Eucalyptus) showed
      relatively low rates of transpiration, with values < 45 kg x tree(-1) x d(-1).
      When scaled to the plot level, transpiration rates were as high as 2 mm/d for
      sites that contained both species with high transpiration rates and high
      densities of planted trees. Because plot-level transpiration is highly dependent 
      on tree density, we modeled transpiration as a function of both species and
      density to evaluate a likely range of values in irrigated urban forests. The
      results show that urban forests in irrigated, semi-arid regions can constitute a 
      significant use of water, but water use can be mitigated by appropriate selection
      of site, management method, and species.

      lace bug, Corythucha ciliata.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1673/031.011.0116 [doi]
AB  - The sycamore lace bug, Corythucha ciliata (Say) (Hemiptera: Tingidae), is an
      important invasive exotic pest of Platanus (Proteales: Platanaceae) trees in
      China. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of temperature on
      C. ciliata in the laboratory so that forecasting models based on heat
      accumulation units could be developed for the pest. Development and fecundity of 
      C. ciliata reared on leaves of London plane tree (Platanus x acerifolia) were
      investigated at seven constant temperatures (16, 19, 22, 26, 30, 33, and 36
      degrees C) and at a relative humidity of 80% with a photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D).
      The developmental time was found to significantly decrease with increasing
      temperature. The developmental time from egg hatching to adult emergence was
      respectively 47.6, 35.0, 24.1, 20.0, and 17.1 days at the temperatures of 19, 22,
      26, 30, and 33 degrees C. C. ciliata could not complete full development at 16
      degrees and 36 degrees C. The developmental threshold temperature (C) estimated
      for egg-to-adult was 11.17 degrees C, with a thermal constant of (K) 370.57
      degree-days. Longevity of females was found to be the shortest, 17.7 days at 33
      degrees C and the longest, 58.9 days at 16 degrees C, and that of males was the
      shortest, 19.7 days at 33 degrees C and the longest, 59.7 days at 16 degrees C.
      Fecundity was the highest at 30 degrees C, being 286.8 eggs per female over an
      oviposition period of 8.9 days. Female lifetime fecundity was reduced at other
      temperatures, being the lowest (87.7 eggs per female) at 19 degrees C. The
      population trend index (I) of C. ciliata was the highest (130.1) at 30 degrees C 
      and the lowest (24.9) at 19 degrees C. Therefore, the optimal developmental
      temperature for C. ciliata was determined to be 30 degrees C.

AB  - OPAL is an English national programme that takes scientists into the community to
      investigate environmental issues. Biological monitoring plays a pivotal role
      covering topics of: i) soil and earthworms; ii) air, lichens and tar spot on
      sycamore; iii) water and aquatic invertebrates; iv) biodiversity and hedgerows;
      v) climate, clouds and thermal comfort. Each survey has been developed by an
      inter-disciplinary team and tested by voluntary, statutory and community sectors.
      Data are submitted via the web and instantly mapped. Preliminary results are
      presented, together with a discussion on data quality and uncertainty.
      Communities also investigate local pollution issues, ranging from nitrogen
      deposition on heathlands to traffic emissions on roadside vegetation. Over
      200,000 people have participated so far, including over 1000 schools and 1000
      voluntary groups. Benefits include a substantial, growing database on
      biodiversity and habitat condition, much from previously unsampled sites
      particularly in urban areas, and a more engaged public.

PG  - 819-26
LID - 10.1007/s11356-011-0499-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to investigate natural radionuclide
      uptake and allocation by trees. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from six Scots
      pines (P. sylvestris), six Norway spruces (Picea abies) and one sycamore maple
      (Acer pseudoplatanus) tree, growing on the Borst uranium mill tailings waste pile
      in Slovenia were collected. (238)U, (230)Th, (226)Ra and (210)Pb activity
      concentrations in wood, shoots and 1-year-old needles or leaves were determined. 
      Particular radionuclides were separated from the samples by appropriate
      radiochemical procedures and their activity concentrations measured with an alpha
      spectrometry system. In addition, concentration ratios for different plant parts 
      were calculated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that for all
      radionuclides, the highest activity concentrations were found in foliage,
      followed by shoots and wood. The activity concentrations in trees were from 0.01 
      to 5.4 Bq kg(-1) for (238)U, 0.03-11.3 Bq kg(-1) for (230)Th, 2.7-2,728 Bq kg(-1)
      for (226)Ra and 5.1-321 Bq kg(-1) for (210)Pb. All activity concentrations were
      calculated on dry weight basis. The calculated concentration ratios were from
      1.05E-5 to 5.39E-3 for (238)U, 7.65E-6-2.88E-3 for (230)Th, 3.10E-4-3.16E-1 for
      (226)Ra and 6.70E-4-4.22E-2 for (210)Pb.

TI  - Male circumcision and human papillomavirus studies reviewed by infection stage
      and virus type.
PG  - S11-8
AB  - The unkeratinized epithelium of the inner human foreskin is thought to be more
      susceptible to human papillomavirus (HPV) entry than the rest of the penis.
      However, studies exploring a potential association between male circumcision and 
      HPV infection have produced conflicting results. The present review stratifies
      the evidence based on methods of sampling and detection of HPV infection, HPV
      type, and the stage of infection. This approach reveals that circumcision reduces
      the risk of HPV infection in a stage- and type-specific manner. There is no
      consistent association of HPV acquisition with circumcision status, indicating
      that circumcised men may be no more protected from initial HPV infection than
      their uncircumcised peers. Circumcision is not protective against nononcogenic
      types of HPV, but is associated with a reduced prevalence and persistence of
      oncogenic HPV infections. Circumcised men are also less susceptible to multiple
      infections. These findings indicate that circumcision modulates HPV persistence
      rather than acquisition. Through promoting HPV infection clearance, male
      circumcision could be an important adjunct to education, condom use, and
      vaccination in reducing the global burden of HPV morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Supercooling capacity and cold hardiness of the adults of the sycamore lace bug, 
      corythucha ciliata (Hemiptera:Tingidae).
PG  - 445-53
AB  - Supercooling point (SCP) of female adults of Corythucha ciliata was significantly
      lower than that of male adults, with an average being -11.49 degrees C and -9.54 
      degrees C, respectively. Low temperature survival of adults of different ages
      indicated that there were differences in cold survival ability among age groups
      of adults. Nonlinear regression analysis found that the response of C. ciliata
      adults to exposure time under different low temperature regimes (above -5 degrees
      C) was best fitted by a logistic equation. Both low temperature and exposure time
      had significant effects on mortality of adults. Temperatures above 5 degrees C
      did not prevent C. ciliata adults from surviving. C. ciliata was shown to be a
      freeze-intolerant but chill-tolerant insect. C. ciliata could tolerate subzero
      temperatures by supercooling. Temperature around -8 degres C is a critical point 
      for successful overwintering of C. ciliata adults, which can establish in the
      whole areas where Platanus trees are planted in China.

      the development of these traits, their longitudinal association with conduct
      problems (CP), and their psychosocial predictors and outcomes. Using a large
      sample of children followed longitudinally from the Twins Early Development Study
      (N=9,578), we described the joint developmental trajectories of CU traits and CP 
      during childhood (between ages 7 and 12) and examined the child- and family-level
      predictors (4 years old) and concomitant outcomes (12 years old) associated with 
      the trajectories. The developmental trajectories were characterized with
      teachers' ratings of CU traits and CP from ages 7 to 12. Using general growth
      mixture modeling, we identified four trajectories of CU traits (stable high,
      increasing, decreasing, and stable low) and two trajectories of CP (high and
      low). Compared with the children who followed a low trajectory of CU traits and
      CP, those who followed a high trajectory of CU traits and CP had more negative
      child- and family-level predictors at 4 years (including CP, hyperactivity,
      negative parental discipline, and chaos in the home). Children with high or
      increasing levels of CU traits and concomitant high levels of CP presented the
      most negative outcomes at 12 years (including hyperactivity, peer problems,
      emotional problems, and negative parental feelings). Children with high CU traits
      and concomitant high levels of CP in childhood should be prioritized for targeted
      intervention.

AB  - Chitosan (CHT) is a natural, non-toxic, and inexpensive compound obtained by
      partial alkaline deacetylation of chitin, the main component of the exoskeleton
      of crustaceans and other arthropods. The unique physiological and biological
      properties of CHT make this polymer useful for a wide range of industries. In
      agriculture, CHT is used to control numerous pre- and postharvest diseases on
      various horticultural commodities. In recent years, much attention has been
      devoted to CHT as an elicitor of defense responses in plants, which include
      raising of cytosolic Ca(2+), activation of MAP kinases, callose apposition,
      oxidative burst, hypersensitive response, synthesis of abscisic acid, jasmonate, 
      phytoalexins, and pathogenesis-related proteins. In this work, we investigated
      the effects of different CHT concentrations on some defense/stress responses of
      sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cultured cells. CHT induced accumulation of
      dead cells, and of cells with fragmented DNA, production of H(2)O(2) and nitric
      oxide, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrion, accumulation of regulative
      14-3-3 proteins in the cytosol and of HSP70 molecular chaperone binding protein
      in the endoplasmic reticulum, accompanied by marked modifications in the
      architecture of this cell organelle.

AB  - * In plant cells, sugar starvation triggers a cascade of effects at the scale of 
      1-2 days. However, very early metabolic response has not yet been investigated. *
      Soluble phosphorus (P) compounds and intracellular pHs were analysed each 2.5 min
      intervals in heterotrophic sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells using in vivo
      phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance ((31)P-NMR). * Upon external-sugar
      withdrawal, the glucose 6-P concentration dropped in the cytosol, but not in
      plastids. The released inorganic phosphate (Pi) accumulated transiently in the
      cytosol before influx into the vacuole; nucleotide triphosphate concentration
      doubled, intracellular pH increased and cell respiration decreased. It was
      deduced that the cytosolic free-sugar concentration was low, corresponding to
      only 0.5 mM sucrose in sugar-supplied cells. * The release of sugar from the
      vacuole and from plastids is insufficient to fully sustain the cell metabolism
      during starvation, particularly in the very short term. Similarly to
      Pi-starvation, the cell's first response to sugar starvation occurs in the
      cytosol and is of a metabolic nature. Unlike the cytoplasm, cytosolic homeostasis
      is not maintained during starvation. The important metabolic changes following
      cytosolic sugar exhaustion deliver early endogenous signals that may contribute
      to trigger rescue metabolism.

      Irish immigrant fiction, 1860-75.
PG  - 331-46
LID - 10.1080/09670882.2010.493026 [doi]
AB  - The prose fiction that remembers the trials of starvation and eviction of the
      Great Famine (1845-50) often juxtaposes representations of blasted, infertile
      land with images of a green, idyllic Erin. Through a discussion of Mary Anne
      Sadlier's Bessy Conway (1861), Elizabeth Hely Walshe's Golden Hills: A Tale of
      the Irish Famine (1865) and John McElgun's Annie Reilly (1873), this article
      reveals that immigrant writers of the Famine generation often negotiate
      depictions of Famine-stricken wasteland with evocations of a pastoral homeland.
      In the case of the two Catholic novels, Bessy Conway and Annie Reilly, the
      pastoral becomes a point of ethnic identification through which the immigrants
      can recollect and reconstruct a sense of Irishness in exile. By contrast, Golden 
      Hills, which focuses on the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, does not lament the mass
      exodus of afflicted Irish: the novel rather envisions emigration as a way to
      regenerate Ireland as locus amoenus.

LID - 10.1016/j.jplph.2010.05.014 [doi]
AB  - The phytohormone ethylene is involved in many physiological and developmental
      processes of plants, as well as in stress responses and in the development of
      disease resistance. Fusicoccin (FC) is a well-known phytotoxin, that in sycamore 
      (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cultured cells, induces a set of stress responses,
      including synthesis of ethylene. In this study, we investigated the possible
      involvement of ethylene in the FC-induced stress responses of sycamore cells by
      means of Co(2+), a well-known specific inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis. Co(2+)
      inhibited the accumulation of dead cells in the culture, the production of nitric
      oxide (NO) and of the molecular chaperone Binding Protein (BiP) in the
      endoplasmic reticulum induced by FC. By contrast, Co(2+) was ineffective on the
      FC-induced accumulation of cells with fragmented DNA, production of H(2)O(2) and 
      release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrion, and only partially reduced the
      accumulation of regulative 14-3-3 proteins in the cytosol. In addition, we
      compared the effect of FC on the above parameters with that of the
      ethylene-releasing compound ethephon (2-chloroethane phosphonic acid). The
      results suggest that ethylene is involved in several stress responses induced by 
      FC in sycamore cells, including a form of cell death that does not show apoptotic
      features and possibly involves NO as a signaling molecule.

PG  - 453-8

AB  - To investigate the short-term consequences of direct competition between beech
      and sycamore maple on root N uptake and N composition, mycorrhizal seedlings of
      both tree species were incubated for 4 days (i.e. beech only, sycamore maple only
      or both together) in an artificial nutrient solution with low N availability. On 
      the fourth day, N uptake experiments were conducted to study the effects of
      competition on inorganic and organic N uptake. For this purpose, multiple N
      sources were applied with a single label. Furthermore, fine roots were sampled
      and analysed for total amino acids, soluble protein, total nitrogen, nitrate and 
      ammonium content. Our results clearly show that both tree species were able to
      use inorganic and organic N sources. Uptake of inorganic and organic N by beech
      roots was negatively affected in the presence of the competing tree species. In
      contrast, the presence of beech stimulated inorganic N uptake by sycamore maple
      roots. Both the negative effect of sycamore maple on N uptake of beech and the
      positive effect of beech on N uptake of sycamore maple led to an increase in root
      soluble protein in beech, despite an overall decrease in total N concentration.
      Thus, beech compensated for the negative effects of the tree competitor on N
      uptake by incorporating less N into structural N components, but otherwise
      exhibited the same strategy as the competitor, namely, enhancing soluble protein 
      levels in roots when grown under competition. It is speculated that enhanced
      enzyme activities of so far unknown nature are required in beech as a defence
      response to inter-specific competition.

AB  - Although platinum chemotherapy remains the standard treatment for ovarian cancer,
      recent advances in novel targeted drugs have generated anticipation and
      excitement. In addition, alternate administration schedules of already
      established cytotoxics have shown promise in both front line and recurrent
      disease settings. In this review, we outline the seminal trials that influenced
      our current management as well as introduce recent trials that have provided
      intriguing results to aid the understanding of ovarian tumour biology.

TI  - Proteomic approach to analyze dormancy breaking of tree seeds.
PG  - 15-25
LID - 10.1007/s11103-010-9623-6 [doi]
AB  - In forest broadleaves from the temperate zone, a large number of species exhibit 
      seed dormancy phenomena. Tree seeds show some of the most pronounced and
      complicated forms of dormancy in the plant kingdom. Many seeds are deeply
      physiologically dormant whatever their moisture level and age. However, dormancy 
      can usually be overcome by a cold or warm stratification for several months. The 
      transition from seed dormancy to germination is a multi-step process. In
      combination with the availability of genome sequence data, proteomics has opened 
      up enormous possibilities for identifying the total set of expressed proteins as 
      well as expression changes during dormancy breaking. The proteomic approach used 
      for analysis of dormancy breaking of tree seeds offers new data allowing better
      understanding of the mechanism of deep physiological dormancy. The results of
      proteomic studies on dormancy breaking and the presence of abscisic and
      gibberellic acids in tree seeds (beech Fagus sylvatica L., Norway maple Acer
      platanoides L. and sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus L.), help to explain this process
      better. Most of the changes in protein expression were observed at the end of
      stratification and in the germinated seeds. This is the most active period of
      dormancy breaking when seeds pass from the quiescent state to germination. The
      analysis of the proteins' function showed that the mechanism of seed dormancy
      breaking involves many processes. Energy metabolism, proteasome, transcription,
      protein synthesis, signal transduction and methionine metabolism proteins have a 
      special importance.

TI  - Effects of larval host plant species on fecundity of the generalist insect
      herbivore Ennomos subsignarius (Lepidoptera: Geometridae).
PG  - 121-6
LID - 10.1603/EN09117 [doi]
AB  - The elm spanworm, Ennomos subsignarius Hubner (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), is an
      eruptive herbivore that feeds on numerous tree species in forests throughout its 
      range. An unprecedented outbreak in an urban environment in St. John's,
      Newfoundland, Canada, caused severe levels of defoliation to a number of native
      and exotic hardwood tree species, some of which represent novel hosts for this
      insect. Increased insect performance on these novels hosts was hypothesized as
      having contributed to the outbreak. To assess this, percentage larval survival
      and pupal weight were measured for larvae reared on foliage from six different
      tree species in a no-choice laboratory bioassay. Adult longevity and fecundity
      (no. eggs laid per female) were assessed for laboratory-reared individuals, as
      well as for pupae collected from eight different host tree species from the
      field. A survey to assess feeding occurrence measured defoliation on eight tree
      species. During this urban outbreak, sycamore maple, Acer pseudoplatanus, a tree 
      species not native to North America, experienced the highest levels of
      defoliation. Performance of E. subsignarius (pupal weight, female longevity, and 
      fecundity) on this host was comparable with the known host of elm (Ulmus spp.).
      Despite the fact that E. subsignaria performed well on several introduced hosts, 
      fecundity levels were much lower than previously published reports, suggesting
      that the current outbreak is not caused by increased fecundity on these novel
      hosts in contrast to the hypothesis.

      an interrupted time-series analysis of September 11 and Oklahoma City.
PG  - 659-70
LID - 10.1521/suli.2009.39.6.659 [doi]
AB  - There is substantial evidence of detrimental psychological sequelae following
      disasters, including terrorist attacks. The effect of these events on extreme
      responses such as suicide, however, is unclear. We tested competing hypotheses
      about such effects by employing autoregressive integrated moving average
      techniques to model the impact of September 11 and the Oklahoma City bombing on
      monthly suicide counts at the local, state, and national level. Unlike prior
      studies that provided conflicting evidence, rigorous time series techniques
      revealed no support for an increase or decrease in suicides following these
      events. We conclude that while terrorist attacks produce subsequent psychological
      morbidity and may affect self and collective efficacy well beyond their immediate
      impact, these effects are not strong enough to influence levels of suicide
      mortality.

TI  - Differences in female and male involvement in lethal violence in Russia.
PG  - 55-64
AB  - Relatively little is known of the distributions of homicide event characteristics
      in non-Western nations in which women relative to men are involved. This article 
      utilizes unique homicide narratives drawn from Russian court and police records
      to compare homicide victim, offender, and event characteristics by sex of victim 
      and separately by sex of offender. Results from logistic regression show that
      homicides in which a female was the victim or offender were more likely to occur 
      between intimates and to occur in the home, whereas homicides involving males
      were more likely to occur in a public place, to be alcohol-related, to involve a 
      firearm, and to involve a victim and offender who did not know each other well.
      These results not only present an important first glimpse at women as homicide
      victims and offenders in Russia specifically, but also provide a point of
      comparison with findings from similar analyses undertaken in the West, and
      present further initial observations upon which to construct a cohesive theory
      about female involvement in serious violent events.

AB  - Air-fluidized support surface therapy has many drawbacks, such as dehydration, in
      an already difficult recovery for those wound patients who have undergone flap
      and graft surgery. In addition, patient care and handling are also problematic.
      Patients complain of discomfort, and the instability of the surface interferes
      with patient stability in side lying and semi-Fowler's positions. Alternative
      support surfaces can be considered for postflap or postgraft patients. Such
      technologies as alternating pressure, low-air-loss, and therapeutic nonpowered,
      advanced, and lateral rotation surfaces are widely used for pressure management
      in high-risk patients and those with existing pressure ulcers. These surfaces
      must be used within a total pressure ulcer management program that includes
      frequent turning and repositioning, skin and ulcer care according to
      evidence-based protocols, patient and caregiver instruction, nutrition, and
      offloading and positioning. The proposed recommendations require more research on
      the relative effectiveness of less expensive and more user-friendly support
      surfaces such as low-air-loss and nonpowered advanced support surfaces and is
      necessary in order to conclusively recommend one type of surface over another.
      However, at this time the available clinical studies and opinions remain
      positive.

TI  - Immune response profiles after caterpillar exposure: a case report.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - RATIONALE: The role of the immune response to caterpillar exposure is not well
      described. This case study is the first to report a patient who presented with an
      allergic reaction after exposure to the larvae of the sycamore tussock moth,
      Halysidota harrisii Walsh, 1864. METHODS: Blood was collected from an allergic
      asthmatic adult (m/42 y/o) at 2 hrs - 2 wks after contact urticaria with
      associated dyspnea after exposure to the larvae of the sycamore tussock moth,
      Halysidota harrisii Walsh, 1864. Distributions of blood lymphocytes (CD4(+),
      CD8(+), CD8(+)CD60(+), CD19(+), CD23(+), CD16/56(+), CD25, CD45RA(+), CD45RO(+)),
      monocytes (CD1d(+)), levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE), and
      cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-4, TNF-alpha) were studied (flow cytometry,
      nephelometry, UniCAP Total IgE Fluoroenzymeimmunoassay, cytokine ELISA, clinical 
      toxicology). RESULTS: Numbers of CD4(+) T cells, CD25(+) cells, CD19(+) B cells, 
      and CD1d(+) monocytes decreased (22, 27, 33, 20%, respectively) one week post
      reaction, CD45RA(+) naive T cells decreased at 36 hours (21%),while CD8(+)CD60(+)
      T cells and CD23(+) cells decreased 48 hrs (33, 74%, respectively) post reaction.
      In contrast, numbers of CD16/56(+) NK precursor cells increased (60%) 12 hrs,
      then decreased (65%) 48 hrs post reaction; other lymphocyte subsets were
      unaffected. Serum IgM, IgG and IgA were within normal range; however, serum IgE
      demonstrated a bimodal elevation at 2 hrs (15%) and one week post reaction.
      Levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4, and TNF-alpha were not detected in serum pre-exposure 
      (<1.0-4.0 pg/mL). However, high levels of IFN-gamma (187-319 pg/mL) and TNF-alpha
      (549-749 pg/mL) were detected in serum 24-36 hrs and 3.5-24 hrs post reaction,
      respectively. In contrast, levels of IL-4 were undetected (<1.0 pg/mL) in serum
      at all time points. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to the larvae of the sycamore tussock
      moth, Halysidota harrisii Walsh, 1864 may result in increased cytokine levels and
      blood CD16/56(+) NK precursor cells.

AB  - In the field of wound care, the management of nonhealing wounds requires
      particular attention. Biopsy is often performed in such cases to rule out
      underlying malignancy; however, the differential remains broad. In the following 
      case, we discuss a nonhealing post traumatic wound in a diabetic patient,
      secondary to unrecognized tophus.

      (IC(50) 0.4 microg/mL), were isolated from the leaves of the common American
      sycamore, Platanus occidentalis. Compounds 2-4 are new. Due to the unusual
      selectivity, potency, and safety of the pure compounds and the semipure glycoside
      mixture against MRSA, it is clear that this represents a viable class of
      inhibitors to prevent growth of MRSA on surfaces and systemically.

TI  - The effects of gap size on some microclimate variables during late summer and
      autumn in a temperate broadleaved deciduous forest.
PG  - 119-29
LID - 10.1007/s00484-009-0260-1 [doi]
AB  - The creation of gaps can strongly influence forest regeneration and habitat
      diversity within forest ecosystems. However, the precise characteristics of such 
      effects depend, to a large extent, upon the way in which gaps modify microclimate
      and soil water content. Hence, the aim of this study was to understand the
      effects of gap creation and variations in gap size on forest microclimate and
      soil water content. The study site, in North West England, was a mixed temperate 
      broadleaved deciduous forest dominated by mature sessile oak (Quercus petraea),
      beech (Fagus sylvatica) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) with some representatives of
      sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus). Solar radiation (I), air temperature (T(A)), soil
      temperature (T(S)), relative humidity (h), wind speed (v) and soil water content 
      (Psi) were measured at four natural treefall gaps created after a severe storm in
      2006 and adjacent sub-canopy sites. I, T(A), T(S), and Psi increased
      significantly with gap size; h was consistently lower in gaps than the sub-canopy
      but did not vary with gap size, while the variability of v could not be explained
      by the presence or size of gaps. There were systematic diurnal patterns in all
      microclimate variables in response to gaps, but no such patterns existed for Psi.
      These results further our understanding of the abiotic and consequent biotic
      responses to gaps in broadleaved deciduous forests created by natural treefalls, 
      and provide a useful basis for evaluating the implications of forest management
      practices.

TI  - Phosphate (Pi) starvation effect on the cytosolic Pi concentration and Pi
      exchanges across the tonoplast in plant cells: an in vivo 31P-nuclear magnetic
      resonance study using methylphosphonate as a Pi analog.
PG  - 1646-57
LID - 10.1104/pp.109.144626 [doi]
AB  - In vivo (31)P-NMR analyses showed that the phosphate (Pi) concentration in the
      cytosol of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) 
      cells was much lower than the cytoplasmic Pi concentrations usually considered
      (60-80 mum instead of >1 mm) and that it dropped very rapidly following the onset
      of Pi starvation. The Pi efflux from the vacuole was insufficient to compensate
      for the absence of external Pi supply, suggesting that the drop of cytosolic Pi
      might be the first endogenous signal triggering the Pi starvation rescue
      metabolism. Successive short sequences of Pi supply and deprivation showed that
      added Pi transiently accumulated in the cytosol, then in the stroma and matrix of
      organelles bounded by two membranes (plastids and mitochondria, respectively),
      and subsequently in the vacuole. The Pi analog methylphosphonate (MeP) was used
      to analyze Pi exchanges across the tonoplast. MeP incorporated into cells via the
      Pi carrier of the plasma membrane; it accumulated massively in the cytosol and
      prevented Pi efflux from the vacuole. This blocking of vacuolar Pi efflux was
      confirmed by in vitro assays with purified vacuoles. Subsequent incorporation of 
      Pi into the cells triggered a massive transfer of MeP from the cytosol to the
      vacuole. Mechanisms for Pi exchanges across the tonoplast are discussed in the
      light of the low cytosolic Pi level, the cell response to Pi starvation, and the 
      Pi/MeP interactive effects.

PG  - 267-71

AB  - This study examines the food-chain transfer of Zn from two plant species, Urtica 
      dioica (stinging nettle) and Acer pseudoplatanus (sycamore maple), into their
      corresponding aphid species, Microlophium carnosum and Drepanosiphum platanoidis.
      The plants were grown in a hydroponic system using solutions with increasing
      concentrations of Zn from 0.02 to 41.9 mg Zn/l. Above-ground tissue
      concentrations in U. dioica and M. carnosum increased with increasing Zn exposure
      (p < 0.001). Zn concentrations in A. pseudoplatanus also increased with solution 
      concentration from the control to the 9.8 mg Zn/l solution, above which
      concentrations remained constant. Zn concentrations in both D. platanoidis and
      the phloem tissue of A. pseudoplatanus were not affected by the Zn concentration 
      in the watering solution. It appears that A. pseudoplatanus was able to limit Zn 
      transport in the phloem, resulting in constant Zn exposure to the aphids. Zn

TI  - Assimilation of xylem-transported 13C-labelled CO2 in leaves and branches of
      sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.).
PG  - 3809-17
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erp222 [doi]
AB  - Previous reports have shown that CO(2) dissolved in xylem sap in tree stems can
      move upward in the transpiration stream. To determine the fate of this dissolved 
      CO(2), the internal transport of respired CO(2) at high concentration from the
      bole of the tree was simulated by allowing detached young branches of sycamore
      (Platanus occidentalis L.) to transpire water enriched with a known quantity of
      (13)CO(2) in sunlight. Simultaneously, leaf net photosynthesis and CO(2) efflux
      from woody tissue were measured. Branch and leaf tissues were subsequently
      analysed for (13)C content to determine the quantity of transported (13)CO(2)
      label that was fixed. Treatment branches assimilated an average of 35% (SE=2.4)
      of the (13)CO(2) label taken up in the treatment water. The majority was fixed in
      the woody tissue of the branches, with smaller amounts fixed in the leaves and
      petioles. Overall, the fixation of internally transported (13)CO(2) label by
      woody tissues averaged 6% of the assimilation of CO(2) from the atmosphere by the
      leaves. Woody tissue assimilation rates calculated from measurements of (13)C
      differed from rates calculated from measurements of CO(2) efflux in the lower
      branch but not in the upper branch. The results of this study showed
      unequivocally that CO(2) transported in xylem sap can be fixed in photosynthetic 
      cells in the leaves and branches of sycamore trees and provided evidence that
      recycling of xylem-transported CO(2) may be an important means by which trees
      reduce the carbon cost of respiration.

TI  - A new treatment option for laryngeal sensory neuropathy.
PG  - 1844-7
LID - 10.1002/lary.20553 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Laryngeal sensory neuropathy (LSN) may produce a variety
      of symptoms, including chronic cough, globus sensation, odynophonia, and/or
      odynophagia. Etiologies are often iatrogenic, viral, or idiopathic, although the 
      diagnosis is generally one of exclusion. The aim of this study is to introduce
      pregabalin (Lyrica, Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) as a potential new therapy for
      LSN. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical investigation. METHODS: : Charts were
      reviewed from 12 consecutive patients who were prescribed pregabalin for symptoms
      of LSN. Outcomes were reviewed by analyzing pre and post-treatment questionnaires
      asking patients to rate symptoms on a scale from 0 to 5. Adverse effects and
      evidence of drug tolerance were also recorded. RESULTS: Two patients did not
      tolerate pregabalin due to somnolence. Of those that tolerated the medication,
      mean pretreatment chief complaint symptom severity rating was 3.9, whereas mean
      post-treatment symptom rating was 1.2 after 1 month of pregabalin therapy. None
      of the patients developed drug tolerance effects over time. CONCLUSIONS:
      Pregabalin therapy appears to be an effective treatment option for laryngeal
      sensory neuropathy. Future prospective studies are needed to compare outcomes
      between pregabalin and other medications as treatments for LSN.

      human health benefits: a case study in London.
PG  - 2645-53
LID - 10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.005 [doi]
AB  - The role of vegetation in mitigating the effects of PM(10) pollution has been
      highlighted as one potential benefit of urban greenspace. An integrated modelling
      approach is presented which utilises air dispersion (ADMS-Urban) and particulate 
      interception (UFORE) to predict the PM(10) concentrations both before and after
      greenspace establishment, using a 10 x 10 km area of East London Green Grid
      (ELGG) as a case study. The corresponding health benefits, in terms of premature 
      mortality and respiratory hospital admissions, as a result of the reduced
      exposure of the local population are also modelled. PM(10) capture from the
      scenario comprising 75% grassland, 20% sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.)
      and 5% Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) was estimated to be
      90.41 t yr(-1), equating to 0.009 t ha(-1) yr(-1) over the whole study area. The 
      human health modelling estimated that 2 deaths and 2 hospital admissions would be
      averted per year.

TI  - Reduction in suicide mortality following a new national alcohol policy in
      Slovenia: an interrupted time-series analysis.
PG  - 915-20
LID - 10.2105/AJPH.2008.146183 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impact on suicide mortality of a new national policy 
      in Slovenia that limits the availability of alcohol. METHODS: We obtained monthly
      total, male, and female suicide counts in Slovenia between January 1997 and
      December 2005 and then employed autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) 
      techniques to model the effect of the alcohol policy (implemented in March 2003).
      RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the total number of monthly suicides
      following the policy's implementation. Subsequent analyses revealed this
      association to be caused solely by the impact on male suicides. Specifically,
      there was an immediate and permanent reduction of 3.6 male suicides per month
      (95% confidence interval = -0.4, -6.9), or approximately 10% of the
      preintervention average. The policy had no statistically significant effect on
      female suicides. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the effectiveness of this specific
      policy in reducing male suicides in Slovenia and also hint at the potential of
      public policy in reducing the public health burden of alcohol-related harm more
      generally.

PG  - 150-170
LID - 10.1080/15226510802378442 [doi]
AB  - Phytoremediation of trichloroethylene (TCE) can be accomplished using
      fast-growing, deep-rooting trees. The most commonly used tree for
      phytoremediation of TCE has been the hybrid poplar. This study looks at native
      southeastern trees of the United States as alternatives to the use of hybrid
      poplar. The use of native trees for phytoremediation allows for simultaneous
      restoration of contaminated sites. A 2-mo, greenhouse-based study was conducted
      to determine if sycamore (Plantanus L.), eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), 
      sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.), and willow (Salix sachalinensis) trees
      possess the ability to degrade TCE by assessing TCE metabolite formation in the
      plant tissue. In addition to the metabolic capabilities of each tree species,
      growth parameters were measured including change in height, water usage, total
      fresh weight of each tissue type, and calculated total leaf surface area. Willow 
      trees had the greatest increase in height among all trees tested; however, at
      higher concentrations TCE inhibits growth. Sycamore trees had the highest overall
      leaf surface area and total biomass, which correlated with sycamore trees also
      having the highest average water usage over the course of the experiment. Carbon 
      tubes used to sample transpiration gases from sycamore, sweetgum, and cottonwood 
      trees did not contain detectable levels of TCE. Tenex sample collection tubes
      used to sample willow trees during TCE exposure showed average TCE concentrations
      of up to 0.354 ng TCE cm(-2) leaf tissue. All exposed trees contained TCE in the 
      root, stem, and leaf tissues. The concentration of TCE remaining in tissues at
      the conclusion of the experiment varied, with the highest levels found in the
      roots and the lowest levels found in the leaves. Metabolites were also observed
      in different tissue types of all trees tested. The highest concentrations of
      trichloroacetic acid were observed in the leaves of the sycamore trees and
      cottonwood trees. Based on the growth parameters tested and the ability to
      metabolize TCE, sycamore and native cottonwood species are the best candidates
      for phytoremediation from this study.

LID - 10.1016/j.jcws.2008.10.003 [doi]
AB  - Wound closure requires deep understanding of wound physiology, anatomy, and the
      healing phase of the wound. The basic principles of wound closure, diabetes
      control, normal nutrition status, infection control, mechanical stress avoidance,
      and nursing care are all important elements in achieving healing of acute and
      chronic wounds. This goal is achievable only through the interdisciplinary
      approach to wound healing. A number of wound closure techniques are available to 
      the plastic surgeon. This armamentarium includes a variety of techniques, from
      simple primary wound closure to more-sophisticated and -costly flap
      reconstructive techniques. This article summarizes the components of the
      reconstructive ladder for wound closure that are available to the reconstructive 
      surgeon.

      electron, and light microscopy. METHODS: The central epithelium was partially
      removed from ex vivo human corneal buttons. Riboflavin 0.1% solution was applied 
      before ultraviolet A light treatment and then for every 2 minutes for 30 minutes 
      while the corneas were exposed to ultraviolet A light at a wavelength of 370 nm
      and intensity of 3 mW/cm(2). Each cornea was evaluated using confocal, electron, 
      and light microscopy. RESULTS: Confocal microscopy demonstrated normal-appearing 
      corneas on their initial pretreatment examination, with reduced stromal detail.
      After treatment, a superficial layer of highly reflective spherical structures
      (4-10 microm) was observed. Many of these hyperreflective structures appeared up 
      to a depth of 300 microm. The remainder of the corneal stroma and endothelium
      appeared normal. Electron microscopy showed keratocyte apoptotic changes to a
      depth of 300 microm. No observable pathologic changes were seen on histology.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on clinical studies, corneal cross-linking is a promising
      treatment that appears to be safe and to halt ectatic corneal disease
      progression. Initial European studies used animal models to extrapolate human
      protocols. In conjunction with clinical studies, we believe that human ex vivo
      corneal studies provide a means to evaluate the structural and morphological
      changes associated with this procedure, within human corneas, in a manner that
      cannot be accomplished in vivo.

AB  - Preliminary mineral magnetic results from a pilot project investigating the
      suitability of roadside tree leaves as depositories of vehicular pollution are
      presented. Tree leaf surfaces (Lime: Tilia europaea; Sycamore: Acer
      pseudoplatanus) at four roadside and one woodland location in Wolverhampton, UK, 
      have been monitored (July 2003 to November 2003). Mineral magnetic technologies
      have revealed spatial variations of particulate pollution concentration
      throughout the conurbation and data analysis indicates that magnetic
      concentration parameters are suitable proxies for fine particulate pollution,
      which are particularly hazardous to health. Site-specific traffic management and 
      associated vehicle behaviour appear to be chiefly responsible for the magnetic
      concentration differences between sites. Magneto-biomonitoring in this way allows
      the high-resolution spatial mapping of particulate matter (PM) pollution, which
      may also benefit epidemiology in better assessing exposure to vehicular-derived
      particulates. Given the speed, measurement sensitivity and non-destructive nature
      of the technique, it is proposed that this low-cost approach offers some
      advantages over centralised monitoring stations to monitor urban roadside
      particulate pollution.

TI  - Genetic Variability and Host Specialization in the Latin American Clade of
      Ceratocystis fimbriata.
PG  - 1274-84
LID - 10.1094/PHYTO.2003.93.10.1274 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT The Ceratocystis fimbriata complex includes many undescribed species
      that cause wilt and canker diseases of many economically important plants.
      Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences have delineated three geographic clades
      within Ceratocystis fimbriata. This study examined host specialization in the
      Latin American clade, in which a number of lineages were identified using
      sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA. Three
      host-associated lineages were identified from cacao (Theobroma cacao), sweet
      potato (Ipomoea batatas), and sycamore (Platanus spp.), respectively. Isolates
      from these three lineages showed strong host specialization in reciprocal
      inoculation experiments on these three hosts. Six cacao isolates from Ecuador,
      Trinidad, and Columbia differed genetically from other cacao isolates and were
      not pathogenic to cacao in inoculation tests. Further evidence of host
      specialization within the Latin American clade of Ceratocystis fimbriata was
      demonstrated in inoculation experiments in growth chambers using sweet potato,
      sycamore, Colocasia esculenta, coffee (Coffea arabica), and mango (Mangifera
      indica) plants; inoculation experiments in Brazil using Brazilian isolates from
      cacao, Eucalyptus spp., mango, and Gmelina arborea; and inoculation experiments
      in Costa Rica using Costa Rican isolates from cacao, coffee, and Xantho-soma sp. 
      Hosts native to the Americas appeared to be colonized by only select pathogen
      genotypes, whereas nonnative hosts were colonized by several genotypes. We
      hypothesize that local populations of Ceratocystis fimbriata have specialized to 
      different hosts; some of these populations are nascent species, and some
      host-specialized genotypes have been moved to new areas by humans.

AB  - ABSTRACT Spatiotemporal changes in the population structure of Botryosphaeria
      dothidea, causal agent of panicle and shoot blight of pistachio, were analyzed by
      using microsatellite-primed polymerase chain reaction (MPPCR), partial sequences 
      of the RNA polymerase II (RPB2) gene, and vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs).
      We examined 390 isolates, 378 recovered from pistachio in seven counties of
      California from 1990 to 2001 and 12 recovered from peach, apple, and sycamore in 
      Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. Six
      microsatellite primers generated 116 polymorphic bands. Based on MP-PCR data, we 
      observed very high (>98%) levels of genetic identity among populations of B.
      dothidea collected from the commercial pistachio orchards in California. The near
      identity of these populations was supported by VCGs and partial sequences of the 
      RBP2 gene. These findings suggest that populations of B. dothidea from commercial
      pistachio orchards are spatially and temporally stable, at least in the past 5
      years.

TI  - The development and limits of freezing tolerance in Acer pseudoplatanus fruits
      across Europe is dependent on provenance.
PG  - 189-98
AB  - The effects of fruit maturity, at the time of natural dispersal, on subsequent
      desiccation tolerance and sub-zero storage was investigated in three lots of Acer
      pseudoplatanus (sycamore) collected from northern to southern Europe. Fruits from
      the native plant distribution range in Italy had significantly higher desiccation
      tolerance (0.16 g water per g DW) than those from England (0.30) and Norway
      (0.50), confirming that the maximum potential desiccation tolerance in sycamore
      exceeds that of the recalcitrant type. In contrast, the unfrozen water content
      varied only slightly between seedlots, but systematically reduced with
      development (0.35 to 0.27 g water per g DW). Maximum survival (60 percent fruit
      germination) of seven days sub-zero temperature storage coincided with drying the
      Italian fruit lot to c. 0.2 g water per g DW followed by holding at -20 degree C,
      above the onset temperature for freezing, or at -196 degree C (liquid nitrogen). 
      Fruit survival was much lower in the Italian fruits when held at this water
      content and -70 degree C, and in all other combinations of water content,
      temperature and fruit lot provenance. As the risk of nucleation in partially
      dried fruits held at -20 degree C is high, we recommend sycamore fruits are
      cryopreserved for long-term conservation.

TI  - Suppression of Ennomos subsignaria (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) on Acer
      pseudoplatanus (Aceraceae) in an urban forest with bole-implanted acephate.
PG  - 822-8
AB  - Trees in an urban forest are highly valued because they have esthetic appeal,
      provide shade, and improve air quality. During the past 5 yr (2002-2006) in St.
      John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, the elm spanworm, Ennomos subsignaria 
      (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), has reached outbreak densities. Each year,
      hundreds of trees have been completely defoliated, and many more trees have been 
      partially defoliated. Adding to this problem, the larvae, their silk strands, and
      their frass are a considerable nuisance to property owners in areas of high
      larval densities. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of three doses of
      bole-implanted acephate (AceCap 97) for reducing densities and associated
      defoliation of E. subsignaria on sycamore maple, Acer pseudoplatanus L.
      (Aceraceae). During the treatment year (2005), all three doses significantly
      reduced E. subsignaria larval and pupal density; full or two-thirds doses
      significantly reduced defoliation compared with control trees. During the
      posttreatment year (2006), bole-implanted acephate did not affect E. subsignaria 
      egg mass density, survival (= adult emergence), or defoliation. Bole-implanted
      acephate is an effective and practical way of suppressing E. subsignaria
      densities and herbivory in an urban forest where the protection of high-value
      trees and the reduction of environmental contamination are of utmost importance.

      interpretation.
PG  - 308-19
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined interrater reliability of score interpretation on 
      the Sensory Integration and Praxis Tests (SIPT). METHOD: Using SIPT scores of two
      complex cases, 20 trained participants independently rated each case for presence
      of sensory integrative dysfunction and for relevance of specific patterns of
      dysfunction. They also provided comments to justify their ratings. RESULTS:
      Agreement on the presence of sensory integrative dysfunction was 70% for Case A
      and 100% for Case B. Reliability was more variable for dysfunctional pattern
      ratings, ranging from 50% to 100% agreement for Cases A and B, respectively.
      Participants consistently appeared to use configural decision-making strategies
      to guide their ratings. CONCLUSION: Interrater reliability was moderate to high
      for interpretation of the presence of sensory integrative dysfunction using SIPT 
      scores. Less agreement was apparent regarding specific patterns of dysfunction.
      Results suggest that additional clinical information, such as clinical
      observations and case history, may be needed to make reliable distinctions among 
      dysfunctional patterns.

AB  - Violins produced by Antonio Stradivari during the late 17th and early 18th
      centuries are reputed to have superior tonal qualities. Dendrochronological
      studies show that Stradivari used Norway spruce that had grown mostly during the 
      Maunder Minimum, a period of reduced solar activity when relatively low
      temperatures caused trees to lay down wood with narrow annual rings, resulting in
      a high modulus of elasticity and low density. The main objective was to determine
      whether wood can be processed using selected decay fungi so that it becomes
      acoustically similar to the wood of trees that have grown in a cold climate (i.e.
      reduced density and unchanged modulus of elasticity). This was investigated by
      incubating resonance wood specimens of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and sycamore
      (Acer pseudoplatanus) with fungal species that can reduce wood density, but lack 
      the ability to degrade the compound middle lamellae, at least in the earlier
      stages of decay. Microscopic assessment of the incubated specimens and
      measurement of five physical properties (density, modulus of elasticity, speed of
      sound, radiation ratio, and the damping factor) using resonance frequency
      revealed that in the wood of both species there was a reduction in density,
      accompanied by relatively little change in the speed of sound. Thus, radiation
      ratio was increased from 'poor' to 'good', on a par with 'superior' resonance
      wood grown in a cold climate.

TI  - Wetlands as an alternative stable state in desert streams.
PG  - 1261-71
AB  - Historically, desert drainages of the American southwest supported productive
      riverine wetlands (cienegas). Region-wide erosion of cienegas during the late
      19th and early 20th century dramatically reduced the abundance of these
      ecosystems, but recent reestablishment of wetlands in Sycamore Creek, Arizona,
      USA, provides an opportunity to evaluate the mechanisms underlying wetland
      development. A simple model demonstrates that density-dependent stabilization of 
      channel substrate by vegetation results in the existence of alternative stable
      states in desert streams. A two-year (October 2004-September 2006) field survey
      of herbaceous cover and biomass at 26 sites located along Sycamore Creek is used 
      to test the underlying assumption of this model that vegetation cover loss during
      floods is density dependent, as well as the prediction that the distribution of
      vegetation abundance should shift toward bimodality in response to floods.
      Observations of nonlinear, negative relationships between herbaceous biomass
      prior to flood events and the proportion of persistent vegetation cover were
      consistent with the alternative stable state model. In further support of the
      alternative-state hypothesis, vegetation cover diverged from an approximately
      normal distribution toward a distinctly bimodal distribution during the monsoon
      flood season of 2006. These results represent the first empirically supported
      example of alternative-state behavior in stream ecosystems. Identification of
      alternative stable states in desert streams supports recent hypotheses concerning
      the importance of strong abiotic-disturbance regimes and biogeomorphic mechanisms
      in multiple-state ecosystems.

TI  - Comparative measurements of transpiration and canopy conductance in two mixed
      deciduous woodlands differing in structure and species composition.
PG  - 959-70
AB  - Transpiration of two heterogeneous broad-leaved woodlands in southern England was
      monitored by the sap flux technique throughout the 2006 growing season. Grimsbury
      Wood, which had a leaf area index (LAI) of 3.9, was dominated by oak (Quercus
      robur L.) and birch (Betula pubescens L.) and had a continuous hazel (Corylus
      avellana L.) understory. Wytham Woods, which had an LAI of 3.6, was dominated by 
      ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and had only a 
      sparse understory. Annual canopy transpiration was 367 mm for Grimsbury Wood and 
      397 mm for Wytham Woods. These values were similar to those for beech (Fagus
      sylvatica L.) plantations in the same region, and differ from one another by less
      than the typical margin of uncertainty of the sap flux technique. Canopy
      conductance (g(c)), calculated for both woodlands by inverting the
      Penman-Monteith equation, was related to incoming solar radiation (R(G)) and the 
      vapor pressure deficit (D). The response of g(c) to R(G) was similar for both
      forests. Both reference conductance (g(cref)), defined as g(c) at D=1 kPa, and
      stomatal sensitivity (-m), defined as the slope of the logarithmic response curve
      of g(c) to D, increased during the growing season at Wytham Woods but not at
      Grimsbury Wood. The -m/g(cref) ratio was significantly lower at Wytham Woods than
      at Grimsbury Wood and was insufficient to keep the difference between leaf and
      soil water potentials constant, according to a simple hydraulic model. This meant
      that annual water consumption of the two woodlands was similar despite different 
      regulatory mechanisms and associated short-term variations in canopy
      transpiration. The -m/g(cref) ratio depended on the range of D under which the
      measurements were made. This was shown to be particularly important for studies
      conducted under low and narrow ranges of D.

PG  - 978-82
LID - 10.1016/j.ejca.2008.02.040 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To identify factors that may prevent or delay patients referred for
      consideration of phase I studies from commencing such a study. METHODS: A
      retrospective audit of phase I study referrals for the period 1st March to 31st
      August 2005 to the Drug Development Unit was performed. All reasons that led to
      either delay or recruitment failure were documented and analysed. RESULTS: Data
      from 176 patients (105M/71F) were analysed. Median age at referral was 59 years
      and median performance status (PS) was 1. Of these, 56 (32%) were successfully
      recruited in a phase I trial. The median time from trial allocation to
      commencement of treatment was 4.8 weeks. Poor or deteriorating PS was the reason 
      for delay or recruitment failure in 43 (35%) of non-recruited patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Poor or deteriorating PS was the most common factor limiting accrual
      to phase I trials. Better patients' selection on this basis might improve
      recruitment rates.

TI  - Role of nitric oxide in actin depolymerization and programmed cell death induced 
      by fusicoccin in sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cultured cells.
PG  - 449-57
LID - 10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01085.x [doi]
AB  - Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a vital role in plant development and is
      involved in defence mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses. Different
      forms of PCD have been described in plants on the basis of the cell organelle
      first involved. In sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cultured cells, the
      phytotoxin fusicoccin (FC) induces cell death. However, only a fraction of the
      dead cells shows the typical hallmarks of animal apoptosis, including cell
      shrinkage, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and release of cytochrome c 
      from the mitochondrion. In this work, we show that the scavenging of nitric oxide
      (NO), produced in the presence of FC, by
      2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) and
      rutin inhibits cell death without affecting DNA fragmentation and cytochrome c
      release. In addition, we show that FC induces a massive depolymerization of actin
      filaments that is prevented by the NO scavengers. Finally, the addition of
      actin-depolymerizing drugs induces PCD in control cells and overcomes the
      inhibiting effect of cPTIO on FC-induced cell death. Vice versa, the addition of 
      actin-stabilizing drugs to FC-treated cells partially inhibits the
      phytotoxin-induced PCD. These results suggest that besides an apoptotic-like form
      of PCD involving the release of cytochrome c, FC induces at least another form of
      cell death, likely mediated by NO and independent of cytochrome c release, and
      they make it tempting to speculate that changes in actin cytoskeleton are
      involved in this form of PCD.

      illness.
PG  - 134-7
AB  - Stigma is known to have deleterious effects on individuals with psychiatric
      disorders as well as their family members. In this study, we examined stigma with
      regard to career concerns among active duty members of the Air Force with
      children who have psychiatric disorders. Albeit a weak relationship, a bivariate 
      correlation confirmed a significant relationship between the child's mental
      health utilization (i.e., severity of illness) and participants concerns about
      the potential effects on their military (r = 0.423, p < 0.01), as well as
      civilian (r = 0.353, p < 0.01), careers. These findings indicate that among
      military members with children who have psychiatric disorders, illness severity
      significantly relates to concerns about the impact of stigma on careers,
      particularly military careers.

TI  - Tapering of xylem conduits and hydraulic limitations in sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus) trees.
PG  - 653-64
AB  - Vertical conduit tapering is proposed as an effective mechanism to almost
      eliminate the increase in hydraulic resistance with increased height. Despite
      this potential role, very little is known about its changes during ontogeny.
      Here, conduit tapering and stem morphology of young/small and old/tall
      individuals of Acer pseudoplatanus in the field, as well as 3-yr-old grafted
      trees from both age classes, were analysed. The distribution of hydraulic
      resistance along stems was also determined in a subsample of trees. Substantial
      conduit tapering was found in small trees (field-grown and grafted from both age 
      classes), whereas values were lower in tall trees, indicating that tapering was a
      size-related, not an age-related process. Apical conduit diameters were larger in
      tall trees and were inversely correlated with the degree of tapering. Hydraulic
      resistance increased less than linearly with distance from the apex. Its scaling 
      against distance was indistinguishable from that predicted from anatomical
      measurements. Conduit tapering was an effective but partial mechanism of
      compensation for the increase in hydraulic resistance with tree height.
      Size-related changes in tapering and in apical conduit diameters may be explained
      by the combined need to reduce the build-up of hydraulic resistance while
      minimizing the carbon costs of building vessel walls.

TI  - A lead isotopic assessment of tree bark as a biomonitor of contemporary
      atmospheric lead.
PG  - 343-56
AB  - The outermost bark layer of trees, predominantly Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris),
      was sampled at 82 non-urban locations from six arbitrarily designated areas
      (Northwest, Northeast, Central Highlands, Central and East, Central and
      Southwest, Southeast), throughout Scotland during 2002-2003 and analysed for lead
      concentration and stable lead isotopes by flame atomic absorption spectrometry
      (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), respectively.
      The mean lead concentration and mean (206)Pb/(207)Pb ratio (+/-1 standard
      deviation, SD) for bark samples from the areas were as follows: Northwest (8.0 mg
      kg(-1), 1.121+/-0.014, n=17), Northeast (8.9 mg kg(-1), 1.117+/-0.012, n=12),
      Central Highlands (11.3 mg kg(-1), 1.130+/-0.010, n=11), Central and East (35.3
      mg kg(-1), 1.120+/-0.007, n=10), Central and Southwest (20.6 mg kg(-1),
      1.125+/-0.018, n=22) and Southeast (34.4 mg kg(-1), 1.120+/-0.005, n=10), with an
      overall mean lead concentration of 18.5 mg kg(-1) (range 0.6-146 mg kg(-1),
      median 8.4 mg kg(-1)) and an overall mean (206)Pb/(207)Pb ratio of 1.122+/-0.014 
      (range 1.089-1.168, median 1.122). The overall mean (206)Pb/(207)Pb ratio for
      bark was therefore significantly lower (p<0.01, t test) than the mean atmospheric
      (206)Pb/(207)Pb ratio of 1.154+/-0.006 (range 1.144-1.167, n=50) and
      1.154+/-0.010 (range 1.134-1.171, n=26) as determined in rainwater collected
      routinely at Glensaugh, Central Highlands, during 2002 and 2003, respectively.
      The bark (206)Pb/(207)Pb values, 90% of which lay between 1.10 and 1.14, were
      more akin to those recorded for the atmosphere (via rainwater, atmospheric
      particulates, moss, etc.) at various locations throughout Scotland during the
      1990s, a decade over which the use of leaded petrol (mean (206)Pb/(207)Pb
      ratio=1.076+/-0.011) declined markedly before its complete withdrawal in 2000.
      This strongly suggests that the lead content and isotopic composition of tree
      bark from Scots pine, which reputedly sheds its outer layers every couple of
      years or so, reflect exposure to atmospherically deposited lead (in the
      atmosphere or soil) over a much longer time period than just the previous 2-3
      years of exposure to contemporary atmospheric lead. The possible influence of
      soil lead upon tree bark through external attachment was not observed in a
      comparative sub-set study of 27 paired bark (mean (206)Pb/(207)Pb
      ratio=1.122+/-0.016) and surface (0-2 cm) soil (mean (206)Pb/(207)Pb
      ratio=1.145+/-0.022) samples, in only six cases (i.e. 22%) of which did the
      corresponding (206)Pb/(207)Pb ratios agree within +/-2 SD. Likewise, bark
      (206)Pb/(207)Pb values exhibited no discernible trend with distance from the
      nearest road, with similar average values for 0-20 m (1.123+/-0.015, n=34) and
      20-700 m (1.122+/-0.012, n=48), although the corresponding mean (and median) lead
      concentration of 23.5 (10) mg kg(-1) vs. 14.9 (7.5) mg kg(-1) was slightly higher
      for the former. The influence of airborne dusts from waste deposits related to
      former mining/smelting of Wanlockhead/Leadhills lead ores
      ((206)Pb/(207)Pb=1.170+/-0.003) could be seen, however, in the sycamore bark lead
      concentrations of up to 3050 mg kg(-1) and (206)Pb/(207)Pb ratios (1.168-1.171)
      observed at a distance of 0.5 km away.

TI  - The type species of Apiognomonia, A. veneta, with its Discula anamorph is
      distinct from A. errabunda.
PG  - 693-709
AB  - Species of Apiognomonia with their Discula anamorphic states in the Gnomoniaceae,
      Diaporthales, are known throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere and cause
      diseases such as sycamore or plane tree anthracnose. The genus Apiognomonia was
      described based on A. veneta as the type species; however, there has been
      disagreement about whether or not A. veneta is a synonym of A. errabunda. Using
      morphological, ecological, and DNA sequence data we conclude that A. errabunda
      and A. veneta are different species, although very closely related; thus, A.
      veneta is the correct name for the type species of Apiognomonia. This conclusion 
      is based on a combined analysis of sequences from the ITS regions of nuclear rDNA
      for 51 isolates from host plants of eight genera and intron regions from actin,
      calmodulin and translation elongation factor 1-alpha for over 25 isolates. The
      type species of the genus Discula is D. nervisequa, the earliest available
      epithet for D. platani, the lectotype of Discula. D. nervisequa is the anamorph
      of A. veneta. Based on an examination of the type specimen, we determined that
      the commonly used name for the anamorph of A. errabunda, D. umbrinella, refers to
      another species. A. veneta and A. errabunda including their anamorphs are
      described and illustrated. An account of all synonyms and excluded synonyms is
      presented.

TI  - Cyclosporin A inhibits programmed cell death and cytochrome c release induced by 
      fusicoccin in sycamore cells.
PG  - 193-9
AB  - Programmed cell death plays a vital role in normal plant development, response to
      environmental stresses, and defense against pathogen attack. Different types of
      programmed cell death occur in plants and the involvement of mitochondria is
      still under investigation. In sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cultured cells,
      the phytotoxin fusicoccin induces cell death that shows apoptotic features,
      including chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and release of cytochrome c 
      from mitochondria. In this work, we show that cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the 
      permeability transition pore of animal mitochondria, inhibits the cell death, DNA
      fragmentation, and cytochrome c release induced by fusicoccin. In addition, we
      show that fusicoccin induces a change in the shape of mitochondria which is not
      prevented by cyclosporin A. These results suggest that the release of cytochrome 
      c induced by fusicoccin occurs through a cyclosporin A-sensitive system that is
      similar to the permeability transition pore of animal mitochondria and they make 
      it tempting to speculate that this release may be involved in the
      phytotoxin-induced programmed cell death of sycamore cells.

TI  - CO2 fluxes and respiration of branch segments of sycamore (Platanus occidentalis 
      L.) examined at different sap velocities, branch diameters, and temperatures.
PG  - 2159-68
AB  - Respiration of stems and branches of trees (R(S)) has typically been estimated by
      measuring radial CO(2) efflux from woody tissue (E(A)) and rates of efflux are
      often scaled temporally using a temperature relationship (Q(10)). High
      concentrations of CO(2) in xylem sap ([CO(2)*]) have been shown to affect E(A),
      and the transport of CO(2) in the xylem stream has been suggested as a mechanism 
      to explain field observations of temperature-independent fluctuations in E(A).
      Sap velocity and temperature were manipulated in detached branch segments of
      sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.) under controlled conditions to quantify these
      effects. Within individual branches of similar size, E(A) and [CO(2)*] were
      greater at low sap velocity, while the amount of respired CO(2) transported in
      sap (transport flux, F(T)) was greater at high sap velocity. E(A) was linearly
      correlated with [CO(2)*]. In branches of three diameter classes (1, 2, and 3 cm),
      volume-based E(A), F(T), and R(S) did not differ, but surface-area based CO(2)
      fluxes increased with diameter class. Regardless of diameter, E(A) accounted for 
      only 30% of respired CO(2) at high sap velocity, while at low sap velocity, E(A) 
      accounted for 71% of respired CO(2). E(A), F(T), and R(S) measured at 5, 20, and 
      35 degrees C at the same sap velocity showed a typical exponential response to
      temperature. However, at the lowest temperature, E(A) accounted for only 18% of
      the CO(2) released from respiring cells compared with 44% at the highest
      temperature, perhaps due to the effect of temperature on the solubility of CO(2) 
      in water. These results directly demonstrate the transport of respired CO(2) in
      the xylem stream and may help to explain inconsistencies in stem and branch
      respiration measurements made in situ.

TI  - The Papworth Early Rehabilitation Programme: vocational outcomes.
PG  - 671-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are 2.7 million people in the UK receiving incapacity benefits,
      costing approximately pound 18 billion pa. Government has adopted a policy of
      helping claimants back into work, through structured vocational rehabilitation
      schemes. There are no published results of vocational rehabilitation services in 
      the UK. We present the results of the Papworth Trust vocational rehabilitation
      programme. Depending on the severity of their disability, the 'Early Rehab
      Programme' aims to get people on incapacity benefits: (a) into employment, (b)
      fit for and seeking work, (c) involved in voluntary work, (d) education, or (e)
      able to live independently. METHODS: Retrospective chart survey and telephone
      follow up. SETTING: Cambridgeshire. RESULTS: Since 1995, 274 people attended for 
      a preliminary interview, of which 107 subsequently started a full rehab
      programme. Eighty-seven were male and 20 female. Half had been unemployed for
      more than two years. Ninety-four completed the programme, of whom 53 had gained
      employment, 33 were 'work ready' and four were doing voluntary work. At long-term
      follow-up, 52 were employed, 12 were in voluntary work, and 7 had retired on
      medical grounds. CONCLUSIONS: This programme demonstrates that long-term
      Incapacity Benefit recipients can return to sustained employment, as shown in
      those who participated in the Papworth Trust's vocational rehabilitation
      programme.

TI  - Measurement of stem respiration of sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.) trees
      involves internal and external fluxes of CO2 and possible transport of CO2 from
      roots.
PG  - 570-9
AB  - CO(2) released by respiring cells in tree stems can either diffuse to the
      atmosphere or dissolve in xylem sap. In this study, the internal and external
      fluxes of CO(2) released from respiring stems of five sycamore (Platanus
      occidentalis L.) trees were calculated. Mean rates of stem respiration were
      highest in mid-afternoon and lowest at night, and were positively correlated with
      air temperature. Over a 24 h period, on average 34% of the CO(2) released by
      respiring cells in the measured stem segment remained within the tree. CO(2)
      efflux to the atmosphere consisted of similar proportions of CO(2) derived from
      local respiring cells (55%) and CO(2) that had been transported in the xylem
      (45%), indicating that CO(2) efflux does not accurately estimate respiration. A
      portion of the efflux of transported CO(2) appeared to have originated in the
      root system. A modification of the method for calculating stem respiration based 
      on internal and external fluxes of CO(2) was developed to separate efflux due to 
      local respiration from efflux of transported CO(2).

TI  - Change and Stability in the Characteristics of Homicide Victims, Offenders and
      Incidents During Rapid Social Change.
PG  - 331-345
AB  - The Russian homicide rate doubled during the 1990s and is now among the highest
      in the world. During this same period, Russian citizens experienced swift,
      widespread, and meaningful political, economic, and social change. It is likely
      that this profound transition altered structural conditions, cultural norms, and 
      interpersonal relations in a way that led to changes in the nature of
      interpersonal violence. Taking advantage of a unique set of homicide narratives
      drawn from court and police records in the Udmurt Republic, this study examined
      stability and change in the distribution of Russian homicide victim, offender,
      and incident characteristics before and after the fall of the Soviet Union. Odds 
      ratios obtained from logistic regression showed no change in victim
      characteristics, but substantial changes in several offender and incident
      characteristics. We discuss the potential mechanisms through which the structural
      and cultural shifts are resulting in these changes and conclude that the ongoing 
      transition is largely responsible for the changing nature of homicide in Russia. 
      In doing so, we introduce the new term "criminological transition" and suggest
      that Russia (and perhaps other nations) may have experienced a change in its
      crime profile in much the same way as we discuss a "demographic transition" in
      terms of fertility and mortality profiles.

TI  - Descriptive study of 226 patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma in karaj
      city.
PG  - 99-101
AB  - The prevalence of allergic diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis is high 
      in general population and aeroallergens are the most common allergens that cause 
      air way inflammation.The aim of this study was an evaluation of clinical and
      laboratory findings in allergic patients and identification of the most common
      aeroallergen in these patients.A cross-sectional retrospective study was
      conducted on 226 allergic patients who were referred to allergic clinic of Karaj 
      city, and skin prick test response to aeroallergens were studied. The most common
      risk factors in these patients were total IgE more than 100 IU/ml and a positive 
      family history of atopy. Skin prick testing results showed that the most common
      aeroallergens were: herbacee II (62%), sycamore (57%), chenopodium (53%), tree
      mix (50%), herbacee III (47%), grass (43%), ash (40%), herbacee I (37%), cedar
      (27%), cockroach (25%), and mite D.P (19%), D.F (18%).High prevalence of skin
      reactivity to weeds (chenopodium and herbacee) and sycamore indicates variation
      in the prevalence of aeroallergen reactivity in different regions with different 
      climates.

TI  - Student and community outcomes in service-learning: part 2--community outcomes.
PG  - 516-8
AB  - This article is the second of a two-part series reporting outcomes from a
      service-learning program implemented in a bachelor of science in nursing program.
      Part 1 (on pages 512-515) described students' perceptions of outcomes realized
      from the program, and Part 2 describes the community outcomes. The purposes of
      the program were to provide students with history-taking, blood pressure, and
      heart rate assessment skills, and beginning counseling skills, as well as to
      provide the university community with blood pressure screening and counseling in 
      a convenient and accessible location. Data on community outcomes were collected
      on a continual basis during the hypertension screening and counseling program
      implementation. Clients were anonymously surveyed on health behavior actions
      taken after their screening and on the screening process. More than 700 client
      screenings were performed over 2 years, with positive health behavior changes
      being reported by clients.

TI  - Handwriting instruction in elementary schools.
PG  - 461-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Classroom teachers teach handwriting, but when problems arise,
      students are referred to occupational therapy for remediation. This study,
      conducted by occupational therapists, reviews handwriting instruction by
      classroom teachers in one school district. METHOD: Teachers from kindergarten
      through grade 6 were asked to complete an open-ended questionnaire regarding
      handwriting instruction. RESULTS: Teachers differed in their methods of
      instruction, including in the programs and paper used, and practice provided.
      Teachers of grades 5 and 6 had to continue to review handwriting instruction,
      because all students could not fluently use handwriting as a tool of expression. 
      CONCLUSION: Elementary students need structured instruction to develop the motor 
      skill of writing. School-based occupational therapists can support effective
      handwriting instruction by interpreting information from motor learning theory
      pertaining to instruction and practice, which supports acquisition, transfer, and
      retention of handwriting skills. They also need to be cognizant of prior
      handwriting instruction when addressing handwriting difficulties.

TI  - Rapid analysis of organic acids in plant extracts by capillary electrophoresis
      with indirect UV detection: directed metabolic analyses during metal stress.
PG  - 283-90
AB  - A fast, reliable capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method with indirect UV
      detection was optimized and validated to determine the main organic acids
      contained in plants. Citric, malic, succinic, oxalic, formic, fumaric, acetic
      acids, and phosphate were quantified. A rapid separation while keeping a good
      resolution was obtained by optimizing capillary length, separation voltage,
      electrolyte composition, and pH. Analyses were performed in a 30 cm uncoated
      fused-silica capillary (length to the detector window) in the co-electroosmotic
      mode with reversed electroosmotic flow and anodic detection using a -30 kV
      separation voltage. The pH 9.0 electrolyte contained 3 x 10(-4)mol/L
      tetradecyltrimethylammonium and 10(-2)mol/L trimellitate. Separation with
      baseline return was achieved in 100 s. Linearity, detection limits,
      repeatability, reproducibility, and recoveries were evaluated. Mean precision
      values of 0.2 and 3.4% for migration times and time-corrected peak areas,
      respectively, enabled accurate identification and quantification whether in
      standard solutions or in samples. Such performances were perfectly adapted to
      high-throughput routine determinations of organic acids in research or industry. 
      Organic acids were assayed in different plant tissues and cells, including
      sycamore, arabidopsis, buttercup, and pea. Citrate and malate were the most
      abundant in all plants tested with concentrations reaching 18.9 and 22.3
      micromol/g fresh matter, respectively. Cadmium effect on pea leaves metabolism
      was also assessed.

TI  - Fluid phase endocytic uptake of artificial nano-spheres and fluorescent quantum
      dots by sycamore cultured cells: evidence for the distribution of solutes to
      different intracellular compartments.
PG  - 196-200
AB  - Fluid phase endocytic uptake of external solutes in plant cells was further
      substantiated using artificial polystyrene nano-spheres (40 nm) and CdSe/ZnS
      quantum dots (20 nm). Both types of artificial nano-particles were taken up by
      sycamore-cultured cells. However, whereas polystyrene nano-spheres were delivered
      to the central vacuole, CdSe/ZnS nano-dots were sequestered into cytoplasmic
      vesicular structures. Using dextran-Texas Red (m.w. 3,000; d-TR) as additional
      marker, confocal micrographs confirmed the distinct topographic distribution of
      CdSe/ZnS quantum dots within the cell. Initially, d-TR and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots 
      colocalized within cytoplasmic vesicles. After 18 h incubation, d-TR was
      distinctly localized in the vacuole whereas CdSe/ZnS quantum dots remained
      sequestered in cytoplasmic membranous compartments. The data provide a first
      evidence for the rapid distribution of solutes taken up by endocytosis to
      distinct intracellular compartments.

TI  - Expression profiling and individualisation of treatment for ovarian cancer.
PG  - 345-9
AB  - Ovarian cancer is the commonest cause of gynaecological cancer-related mortality.
      Patients with this disease generally undergo surgery followed by platinum-taxane 
      chemotherapy, with additional chemotherapy at relapse. Although the prognosis for
      patients with advanced cancer is poor--a five-year survival of only 30-40%--there
      is a wide range of outcomes for individual patients. To date,
      clinico-pathological variables such as age, stage, grade, histology, debulking
      status and response to chemotherapy continue to provide the basis on which
      treatment decisions are made for individual patients. Immunohistochemical markers
      and information on p53 mutation status have been extensively evaluated in ovarian
      cancer, but have not yet been shown to be sufficiently informative to influence
      clinical decisions on a routine basis. The recent advent of expression profiling 
      has provided a new impetus to identifying clinically useful prognostic markers.
      The ambition of personalised medicine through microarray-based profiling appears 
      to be realistic, but further studies on large uniform cohorts are needed before
      this potential is fully realised.

TI  - The DNA sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1.
PG  - 315-21
AB  - The reference sequence for each human chromosome provides the framework for
      understanding genome function, variation and evolution. Here we report the
      finished sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1. Chromosome 1
      is gene-dense, with 3,141 genes and 991 pseudogenes, and many coding sequences
      overlap. Rearrangements and mutations of chromosome 1 are prevalent in cancer and
      many other diseases. Patterns of sequence variation reveal signals of recent
      selection in specific genes that may contribute to human fitness, and also in
      regions where no function is evident. Fine-scale recombination occurs in hotspots
      of varying intensity along the sequence, and is enriched near genes. These and
      other studies of human biology and disease encoded within chromosome 1 are made
      possible with the highly accurate annotated sequence, as part of the completed
      set of chromosome sequences that comprise the reference human genome.

TI  - Orbital regional anesthesia.
PG  - 221-32
AB  - Orbital regional anesthesia is a useful and safe modality for providing excellent
      operating conditions for the surgeon and painless, pleasant circumstances for the
      patient. It is especially suited for patients who are extremely sensitive and who
      could not tolerate topical anesthesia or a sub-Tenon's block without deep
      sedation. Both intraconal and extraconal techniques can be used safely and
      effectively if proper precautions are taken to enter the safest areas of the
      orbit and to avoid the vascular areas and the deep orbit where structures are
      tightly packed and thus more easily harmed. Thorough knowledge of orbital anatomy
      and understanding of the globe-orbit relationship of every patient are necessary 
      to perform this form of regional anesthesia. In addition, knowledge of the
      effects and side effects of the anesthetics and adjuvants is also required.

TI  - An important pool of sucrose linked to starch biosynthesis is taken up by
      endocytosis in heterotrophic cells.
PG  - 447-56
AB  - We have recently shown the occurrence of endocytic sucrose uptake in
      heterotrophic cells. Whether this mechanism is involved in the sucrose-starch
      conversion process was investigated by comparing the rates of starch accumulation
      in sycamore cells cultured in the presence or absence of the endocytic inhibitors
      wortmannin and 2-(4-morpholynyl-)-8-phenyl-4H-1 benzopyran-4-1 (LY294002). These 
      analyses revealed a two-phase process involving an initial 120 min wortmannin-
      and LY294002-insensitive starch accumulation period, followed by a prolonged
      phase that was arrested by the endocytic inhibitors. Both wortmannin and LY294002
      led to a strong reduction of the intracellular levels of both sucrose and the
      starch precursor molecule, ADPglucose. No changes in maximum catalytic activities
      of enzymes closely linked to starch and sucrose metabolism occurred in cells
      cultured with endocytic inhibitors. In addition, starch accumulation was
      unaffected by endocytic inhibitors when cells were cultured with glucose. These
      results provide a first indication that an important pool of sucrose incorporated
      into the cell is taken up by endocytosis prior to its subsequent conversion into 
      starch in heterotrophic cells. This conclusion was substantiated further by
      experiments showing that sucrose-starch conversion was strongly prevented by both
      wortmannin and LY294002 in both potato tuber discs and developing barley
      endosperms.

TI  - A stable lead isotopic investigation of the use of sycamore tree rings as a
      historical biomonitor of environmental lead contamination.
PG  - 278-91
AB  - The validity of the use of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) tree-rings for the
      reconstruction of atmospheric lead pollution histories was investigated. Tree
      cores spanning 1892-2003 were collected from several sycamores from the eastern
      shore of Loch Lomond, Scotland, an area with no local point sources of lead
      emission. The lead concentration and 206Pb/207Pb profiles of the Loch Lomond
      region cores were compared with corresponding data for the 210Pb-dated loch
      sediment, and also with data for moss of known age from a Scottish herbarium
      collection. Two of the seven sycamore cores showed the same lead concentration
      trend as the lead flux to the loch, the rest having no similarity to either each 
      other or the loch sediment record. Two further sycamore cores showed some
      similarity in their temporal 206Pb/207Pb trends to those seen in the sediment and
      moss records, but only in part of their profiles, whilst the 206Pb/207Pb ratios
      of the other sycamore cores remained relatively unchanged for the majority of the
      time covered, or exhibited an opposite trend. The 206Pb/207Pb ratios of the tree 
      cores were also mostly higher than those of the previously established records
      for any given time period. Tree cores covering 1878-2002 were also collected
      along transects from Wanlockhead and Tyndrum, two areas of former lead mining and
      smelting associated with distinct 206Pb/207Pb ratios of 1.170 and 1.144,
      respectively. The Wanlockhead tree cores exhibited a generally decreasing trend
      in lead concentration with both time and distance from the lead mine. The
      characteristic 206Pb/207Pb ratio of 1.170 was observed in samples close to the
      mine but a decrease in the influence of the mine-derived lead was observed in
      more distant samples. The tree sampled at Tyndrum showed elevated lead
      concentrations, which decreased with time, and a fairly constant 206Pb/207Pb
      ratio of 1.15 reflecting input from the mine, features not observed in any other 
      trees along the transect. Overall the data suggest that sycamore tree-ring
      analysis is an unsuitable method for obtaining records of historical lead
      deposition in areas with no large local lead input, although it can reveal some
      information about the temporal and spatial influence of point source emitters.
      The unsuitability probably arises from the number of active annual rings in a
      single year, the post-uptake radial translocation of elements, the relative
      importance of the different routes of uptake, and the soil depth(s) from which
      trees draw nutrients.

TI  - Intersterility, morphology and taxonomy of Ceratocystis fimbriata on sweet
      potato, cacao and sycamore.
PG  - 57-69
AB  - Ceratocystis fimbriata is a large, diverse complex of species that cause
      wilt-type diseases of many economically important plants. Previous studies have
      shown that isolates in three monophyletic lineages within the Latin American
      clade of C. fimbriata are host-specialized to cacao (Theobroma cacao), sweet
      potato (Ipomoea batatas) and sycamore (Platanus spp.), respectively. We paired
      testers of opposite mating type from isolates of these lineages to find
      intersterility groups. Two intersterility groups corresponded to the sweet potato
      and sycamore lineages, respectively. The cacao lineage contained two
      intersterility groups, corresponding to two genetic sublineages centered in
      western Ecuador and Brazil/Costa Rica/Colombia. Six isolates from cacao that were
      not members of the cacao lineage and were not pathogenic to cacao in an earlier
      study also were intersterile with members of the two cacao intersterility groups.
      Some pairings between testers from different lineages or sublineages yielded
      perithecia from which a few abnormal progeny could be recovered, typical of
      interspecific hybrids. These progeny showed abnormal segregation of the MAT-2
      gene and mycelial morphology, showing that they were indeed the result of
      crosses. Isolates of the sweet potato, cacao, and sycamore lineages were
      indistinguishable morphologically except for the presence or absence of a
      doliform (barrel-shaped) conidial state and minor differences in size of
      perithecial bases and necks and ascospores. C. fimbriata originally was described
      from sweet potato. We describe the cacao pathogen as a new species, Ceratocystis 
      cacaofunesta and we raise the sycamore pathogen from a form to species
      Ceratocystis platani.

TI  - Modeling population genetic data in autotetraploid species.
PG  - 639-46
AB  - Allozyme and PCR-based molecular markers have been widely used to investigate
      genetic diversity and population genetic structure in autotetraploid species.
      However, an empirical but inaccurate approach was often used to infer marker
      genotype from the pattern and intensity of gel bands. Obviously, this introduces 
      serious errors in prediction of the marker genotypes and severely biases the data
      analysis. This article developed a theoretical model to characterize genetic
      segregation of alleles at genetic marker loci in autotetraploid populations and a
      novel likelihood-based method to estimate the model parameters. The model
      properly accounts for segregation complexities due to multiple alleles and double
      reduction at autotetrasomic loci in natural populations, and the method takes
      appropriate account of incomplete marker phenotype information with respect to
      genotype due to multiple-dosage allele segregation at marker loci in tetraploids.
      The theoretical analyses were validated by making use of a computer simulation
      study and their utility is demonstrated by analyzing microsatellite marker data
      collected from two populations of sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), an
      economically important autotetraploid tree species. Numerical analyses based on
      simulation data indicate that the model parameters can be adequately estimated
      and double reduction is detected with good power using reasonable sample size.

TI  - Production physiology of three fast-growing hardwood species along a soil
      resource gradient.
PG  - 1487-94
AB  - We determined how specific leaf area (SLA), specific leaf nitrogen (SLN), leaf
      area index (LAI), light-saturated photosynthesis (Amax) and aboveground net
      primary productivity (ANPP) of three commercially important hardwood species,
      eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr.), American sycamore (Platanus
      occidentalis L.) and cherrybark oak (Quercus falcata var.pagodafolia Ell.), vary 
      across a soil resource gradient. Five treatments were applied in a randomized
      block design (control, irrigation only (IRR), and irrigation plus fertilization
      with 56, 112 or 224 kg N ha-1 year-1 (N56, N112 and N224)) with four replications
      per species. When trees were 6 years old, Amax, SLA, SLN, LAI and ANPP were
      quantified during peak leaf production within a single growing season. In all
      species, Amax for sun leaves was significantly higher than for shade leaves (34, 
      32 and 29 micromol m2 s-1 versus 27, 23 and 23 micromol m2 s-1 for cottonwood,
      cherrybark oak and sycamore sun and shade leaves, respectively) and tended to
      plateau in the N112 treatment. The SLA was significantly lower in sun than in
      shade leaves and reached a plateau in IRR-treated cottonwood and sycamore, and in
      N56-treated oak. Values of SLN peaked in the N122 treatment for cottonwood sun
      leaves (1.73 g N m2) and in the N56 treatment for sycamore and oak (1.54 and 1.90
      g N m2, respectively). In sun and shade leaves of all species, Amax increased
      with increasing SLN. Cherrybark oak LAI reached a plateau across the resource
      gradient in the N56 treatment, whereas cottonwood and sycamore LAI reached a
      plateau in the IRR treatment. All species exhibited significant curvilinear
      relationships between canopy Amax and ANPP. These findings indicate that
      nutrients and water regulate leaf-level traits such as SLA and SLN, which in turn
      influence LAI and canopy photosynthesis, thereby affecting ANPP at the tree and
      stand levels.

TI  - Cloning and characterization of a FLORICAULA/LEAFY ortholog, PFL, in polygamous
      papaya.
PG  - 576-84
AB  - The homologous genes Floricaula (FLO) in Antirrhinum and LEAFY (LFY) in
      Arabidopsis are known to regulate the initiation of flowering in these two
      distantly related plant species. These genes are necessary also for the
      expression of downstream genes that control floral organ identity. We used
      Arabidopsis LFY cDNA as a probe to clone and sequence a papaya ortholog of LFY,
      PFL. It encodes a protein that shares 61% identity with the Arabidopsis LFY gene 
      and 71% identity with the LFY homologs of the two woody tree species: California 
      sycamore (Platanus racemosa) and black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). Despite 
      the high sequence similarity within two conserved regions, the N-terminal
      proline-rich motif in papaya PFL differs from other members in the family. This
      difference may not affect the gene function of papaya PFL, since an equally
      divergent but a functional LFY ortholog Needly of Pinus radiata has been
      reported. Genomic and BAC Southern analyses indicated that there is only one copy
      of PFL in the papaya genome. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that 
      PFL is expressed at a relatively low level in leaf primordia, but it is expressed
      at a high level in the floral meristem. Quantitative PCR analyses revealed that
      PFL was expressed in flower buds of all three sex types - male, female, and
      hermaphrodite with marginal difference between hermaphrodite and unisexual
      flowers. These data suggest that PFL may play a similar role as LFY in flower
      development and has limited effect on sex differentiation in papaya.

TI  - Obtaining sensitive information from a wary population: a comparison of telephone
      and face-to-face surveys of welfare recipients in the United States.
PG  - 976-84
AB  - Recent studies reveal the benefits of technological developments such as audio
      computer assisted self-interviewing (A-CASI) in interview methodology, especially
      for surveys of sensitive behavior and information. However, we believe that the
      selection of mode of administration depends not only on the technology available 
      and the behavior of interest, but also on the specific population under study. We
      therefore assess survey mode effects on reported rates of alcohol and drug use
      among welfare recipients, an especially important group for scholars and public
      health agencies. The sample consisted of adult recipients of Temporary Assistance
      to Needy Families (TANF) in Oklahoma, January 2001. Adjusting for demographic
      characteristics, employment, and education, we employ odds ratios to compare
      30-day, 1 year, and lifetime prevalence estimates from telephone and face-to-face
      surveys. Telephone methodology yields similar or higher estimates for lifetime
      prevalence of alcohol, marijuana, and hard drug use and abuse, though lower
      estimates of recent use. We discuss our findings in relation to underfunded
      public health agencies that must efficiently assess and respond to local levels
      of drug abuse and we conclude that mode selection may depend upon the population 
      under study.

TI  - Neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for extremity soft tissue sarcomas.
PG  - 489-500, vi
AB  - Despite the overall good prognosis in patients who have localized soft tissue
      sarcoma (STS) of the extremities, approximately half of those who have high-risk 
      features ultimately will die from metastatic disease that was present as
      microscopic foci at the time of diagnosis. The principal role of adjuvant and
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy is to improve the "cure" rate through eradication of
      these microscopic foci. Over the last 30 years there have been numerous studies
      attempting to determine whether adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy
      does lead to an improvement in disease-specific survival in patients who have
      localized STS. It is still unclear whether there may be a role for systemic
      chemotherapy in patients who have high-risk localized STS of the extremities.
      This article discusses some of the issues surrounding this most controversial
      area in the management of STS.

TI  - Existence of two parallel mechanisms for glucose uptake in heterotrophic plant
      cells.
PG  - 1905-12
AB  - The implied existence of two mechanisms for glucose uptake into heterotrophic
      plant cells was investigated using the fluorescent glucose derivative 2-NBDG
      (2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose), two membrane
      impermeable fluorescent markers (3000 mol. wt. dextran-Texas Red (d-TR) and
      Alexa-488), hexose carrier and endocytic inhibitors (phloridzin and wortmannin-A,
      respectively), and fluorescent and confocal microscopy. Both phloridzin and
      wortmannin-A significantly reduced the uptake of 2-NBDG into sycamore cultured
      cells, which was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy. Phloridzin prevented 2-NBDG
      uptake exclusively into the cytosol, whereas the wortmannin-A effect was more
      general, with 2-NBDG uptake into the vacuole being the more affected.
      Simultaneous incubation of cells in the membrane-impermeable fluorescent probes
      Alexa-488 and d-TR for 24 h resulted in co-localization of the labelling in the
      central vacuole and other endosomal compartments. Cytoplasts, cells devoid of
      vacuoles, were instrumental in demonstrating the transport of 2-NBDG by separate 
      uptake mechanisms. In cytoplasts incubated simultaneously in 2-NBDG and d-TR for 
      2 h, a green fluorescent cytosol was indicative of transport of hexoses across
      the plasmalemma, while the co-localization of 2-NBDG and d-TR in internal
      vesicles demonstrated transport via an endocytic system. The absence of vesicles 
      when cytoplasts were pre-incubated in wortmannin-A authenticated the endocytic
      vesicular nature of the co-shared 2-NBDG and d-TR fluorescent structures. In
      summary, uptake of 2-NBDG occurs by two separate mechanisms: (i) a
      plasmalemma-bound carrier-mediated system that facilitates 2-NBDG transport into 
      the cytosol, and (ii) an endocytic system that transports most of 2-NBDG directly
      into the vacuole.

TI  - Widespread occurrence of a covalent linkage between xyloglucan and acidic
      polysaccharides in suspension-cultured angiosperm cells.
PG  - 91-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Covalent linkages between xyloglucan and
      rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) have been reported in the primary cell walls of
      cultured Rosa cells and may contribute to wall architecture. This study
      investigated whether this chemical feature is general to angiosperms or whether
      Rosa is unusual. * METHODS: Xyloglucan was alkali-extracted from the walls of
      l-[1-3H]arabinose-fed suspension-cultured cells of Arabidopsis, sycamore, rose,
      tomato, spinach, maize and barley. The polysaccharide was precipitated with 50 % 
      ethanol and subjected to anion-exchange chromatography in 8 m urea. Eluted
      fractions were Driselase-digested, yielding [3H]isoprimeverose (diagnostic of
      [3H]xyloglucan). The Arabidopsis cells were also fed [6-14C]glucuronic acid, and 
      radiolabelled pectins were extracted with ammonium oxalate. * KEY RESULTS:
      [3H]Xyloglucan was detected in acidic (galacturonate-containing) as well as
      non-anionic polysaccharide fractions. The proportion of the [3H]isoprimeverose
      units that were in anionic fractions was: Arabidopsis, 45 %; sycamore, 60 %;
      rose, 44 %; tomato, 75 %; spinach, 70 %; maize, 50 %; barley, 70 %. In
      Arabidopsis cultures fed d-[6-(14)C]glucuronate, 20 % of the
      (galacturonate-14C)-labelled pectins were found to hydrogen-bond to cellulose, a 
      characteristic normally restricted to hemicelluloses such as xyloglucan. *
      CONCLUSIONS: Alkali-stable, anionic complexes of xyloglucan (reported in the case
      of Rosa to be xyloglucan-RG-I covalent complexes) are widespread in the cell
      walls of angiosperms, including gramineous monocots.

AB  - What do linguistic symbols do for minds like ours, and how (if at all) can basic 
      embodied, dynamical, and situated approaches do justice to high-level human
      thought and reason? These two questions are best addressed together, since our
      answers to the first may inform the second. The key move in scaling up simple
      embodied cognitive science is, I argue, to take very seriously the potent role of
      human-built structures in transforming the spaces of human learning and reason.
      In particular, in this article I look at a range of cases involving what I dub
      surrogate situations. Here, we actively create restricted artificial environments
      that allow us to deploy basic perception-action-reason routines in the absence of
      their proper objects. Examples include the use of real-world models, diagrams,
      and other concrete external symbols to support dense looping interactions with a 
      variety of stable external structures that stand in for the absent states of
      affairs. Language itself, I finally suggest, is the most potent and fundamental
      form of such surrogacy. Words are both cheap stand-ins for gross behavioral
      outcomes, and the concrete objects that structure new spaces for basic forms of
      learning and reason. A good hard look at surrogate situatedness thus turns the
      standard skeptical challenge on its head. But it raises important questions
      concerning what really matters about these new approaches, and it helps focus
      what I see as the major challenge for the future: how, in detail, to
      conceptualize the role of symbols (both internal and external) in dynamical
      cognitive processes.

TI  - Comparison between the effects of fusicoccin, Tunicamycin, and Brefeldin A on
      programmed cell death of cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells.
PG  - 61-70
AB  - Programmed cell death occurs in plants during several developmental processes and
      during the expression of resistance to pathogen attack (i.e., the hypersensitive 
      response). An unsolved question of plant programmed cell death is whether a
      unique signaling pathway or different, possibly convergent pathways exist. This
      problem was addressed in cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells by
      comparing the effects of fusicoccin, Tunicamycin and Brefeldin A, inducers of
      programmed cell death with well-defined molecular and cellular targets, on some
      of the parameters involved in the regulation of this process. In addition to cell
      death, the inducers are able to stimulate the production of H2O2, the leakage of 
      cytochrome c from mitochondria, the accumulation of cytosolic 14-3-3 proteins,
      and changes at the endoplasmic reticulum level, such as accumulation of the
      molecular chaperone binding protein and modifications in the organelle
      architecture. Interestingly, no additive effect on any of these parameters is
      observed when fusicoccin is administered in combination with Tunicamycin or
      Brefeldin A. Thus, these inducers seem to utilize the same or largely coincident 
      pathways to induce programmed cell death and involvement of the endoplasmic
      reticulum, in addition to that of mitochondria, appears to be a common step.

TI  - Extraction of species-specific glycan substructures.
PG  - 69-81
AB  - Glycans, which are carbohydrate sugar chains attached to some lipids or proteins,
      have a huge variety of structures and play a key role in cell communication,
      protein interaction and immunity. The availability of a number of glycan
      structures stored in the KEGG/GLYCAN database makes it possible for us to conduct
      a large-scale comparative research of glycans. In this paper, we present a novel 
      approach to compare glycan structures and extract characteristic glycan
      substructures of certain organisms. In the algorithm we developed a new
      similarity measure of glycan structures taking into account of several biological
      aspects of glycan synthesis and glycosyltransferases, and we confirmed the
      validity of our similarity measure by conducting experiments on its ability to
      classify glycans between organisms in the framework of a support vector machine. 
      Finally, our method successfully extracted a set of candidates of substructrues
      which are characteristic to human, rat, mouse, bovine, pig, chicken, yeast, wheat
      and sycamore, respectively. We confirmed that the characteristic substructures
      extracted by our method correspond to the substructures which are known as the
      species-specific sugar chain of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidases in the kidney.

TI  - Sucrose-inducible endocytosis as a mechanism for nutrient uptake in heterotrophic
      plant cells.
PG  - 474-81
AB  - The capacity of plant heterotrophic organs to transport and accumulate incoming
      nutrients (mostly in the form of sucrose) directly impacts their final size, crop
      productivity and nutritional value. Endocytosis as a mechanism for nutrient
      uptake in heterotrophic cells was investigated using suspension culture cells of 
      sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and the endocytic inhibitors wortmannin and
      LY294002. Time course analysis of sucrose uptake in intact walled cells revealed 
      a two-phase process involving an initial 90 min wortmannin- and
      LY294002-insensitive sucrose uptake period, followed by a prolonged phase of
      rapid sucrose accumulation which was greatly inhibited by the two endocytic
      inhibitors. Walled cells were assessed for their capacity to incorporate the
      fluorescent endocytosis marker lucifer yellow-CH (LY) in the presence or absence 
      of sucrose. Rates of sucrose and LY accumulation were virtually identical, as was
      their response to wortmannin. In addition, LY incorporation increased as a
      function of external sucrose concentration. When sucrose was substituted by other
      sugars or amino acids, uptake of LY greatly diminished, indicating that sucrose
      itself is the primary signal of endocytosis. Microscopic observations revealed
      the formation of vesicles containing LY and its eventual accumulation on the
      vacuole when sucrose was present in the incubation medium. These results
      demonstrate the existence of a sucrose-inducible endocytic process as a viable
      mechanism for solute transport into the vacuole of storage cells.

TI  - Radiation-use efficiency and gas exchange responses to water and nutrient
      availability in irrigated and fertilized stands of sweetgum and sycamore.
PG  - 191-200
AB  - We investigated how water and nutrient availability affect radiation-use
      efficiency (epsilon) and assessed leaf gas exchange as a possible mechanism for
      shifts in epsilon. We measured aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and
      annual photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) capture to calculate epsilon as 
      well as leaf-level physiological variables (light-saturated net photosynthesis,
      Asat; stomatal conductance, gs; leaf internal CO2 concentration, Ci; foliar
      nitrogen concentration, foliar [N]; and midday leaf water potential, Psileaf)
      during the second (2001) and third (2002) growing seasons in sweetgum
      (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) and sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.) stands
      receiving a factorial combination of irrigation and fertilization at the Savannah
      River Site, South Carolina. Irrigation and fertilization increased PAR capture
      (maximum increase 60%) in 2001 and 2002 for both species and annual PAR capture
      was well correlated with ANPP (mean r2 = 0.77). A decreasing trend in epsilon was
      observed in non-irrigated stands for sweetgum in 2001 and for sycamore in both
      years, although this was only significant for sycamore in 2002. Irrigated stands 
      maintained higher gas exchange rates than non-irrigated stands for sweetgum in
      2001 and for sycamore in both years, although foliar [N] and Psileaf were
      generally unaffected. Because Ci decreased in proportion to gs in non-irrigated
      stands, it appeared that greater stomatal limitation of photosynthesis was
      associated with decreased Asat. On several measurement dates for sweetgum in 2001
      and for sycamore in both years, epsilon was positively correlated with gas
      exchange variables (Asat, gs, Ci) (r ranged from 0.600 to 0.857). These results
      indicate that PAR capture is well correlated with ANPP and that gas exchange
      rates modified by irrigation can influence the conversion of captured light
      energy to biomass.

TI  - Rhamnogalacturonan II: structure and function of a borate cross-linked cell wall 
      pectic polysaccharide.
PG  - 109-39
AB  - Rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) is a structurally complex pectic polysaccharide
      that was first identified in 1978 as a quantitatively minor component of
      suspension-cultured sycamore cell walls. Subsequent studies have shown that RG-II
      is present in the primary walls of angiosperms, gymnosperms, lycophytes, and
      pteridophytes and that its glycosyl sequence is conserved in all vascular plants 
      examined to date. This is remarkable because RG-II is composed of at least 12
      different glycosyl residues linked together by more than 20 different glycosidic 
      linkages. However, only a few of the genes and proteins required for RG-II
      biosynthesis have been identified. The demonstration that RG-II exists in primary
      walls as a dimer that is covalently cross-linked by a borate diester was a major 
      advance in our understanding of the structure and function of this pectic
      polysaccharide. Dimer formation results in the cross-linking of the two
      homogalacturonan chains upon which the RG-II molecules are constructed and is
      required for the formation of a three-dimensional pectic network in muro. This
      network contributes to the mechanical properties of the primary wall and is
      required for normal plant growth and development. Indeed, changes in wall
      properties that result from decreased borate cross-linking of pectin may lead to 
      many of the symptoms associated with boron deficiency in plants.

TI  - Genetic variation in eastern North American and putatively introduced populations
      of Ceratocystis fimbriata f. platani.
PG  - 2995-3005
AB  - The plant pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis fimbriata f. platani attacks Platanus
      species (London plane, oriental plane and American sycamore) and has killed tens 
      of thousands of plantation trees and street trees in the eastern United States,
      southern Europe and Modesto, California. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
      fingerprints and alleles of eight polymorphic microsatellite markers of isolates 
      of C. fimbriata from these regions delineated major differences in gene
      diversities. The 33 isolates from the eastern United States had a moderate degree
      of gene diversity, and unique genotypes were found at each of seven collection
      sites. Fingerprints of 27 isolates from 21 collection sites in southern Europe
      were identical with each other; microsatellite markers were monomorphic within
      the European population, except that three isolates differed at one locus each,
      due perhaps to recent mutations. The genetic variability of C. fimbriata f.
      platani in the eastern United States suggests that the fungus is indigenous to
      this region. The genetic homogeneity of the fungus in Europe suggests that this
      population has gone through a recent genetic bottleneck, perhaps from the
      introduction of a single genotype. This supports the hypothesis that the pathogen
      was introduced to Europe through Naples, Italy during World War II on infected
      crating material from the eastern United States. The Californian population may
      also have resulted from introduction of one or a few related genotypes because
      it, too, had a single nuclear and mitochondrial genotype and limited variation in
      microsatellite alleles.

TI  - Xylella fastidiosa subspecies: X. fastidiosa subsp. [correction] fastidiosa
      [correction] subsp. nov., X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex subsp. nov., and X.
      fastidiosa subsp. pauca subsp. nov.
PG  - 290-300
AB  - Xylella fastidiosa, a fastidious bacterium causing disease in over 100 plant
      species, is classified as a single species, although genetic studies support
      multiple taxons. To determine the taxonomic relatedness among strains of X.
      fastidiosa, we conducted DNA-DNA relatedness assays and sequenced the 16S-23S
      intergenic spacer (ITS) region using 26 strains from 10 hosts. Under stringent
      conditions (Tm -15 degrees C), the DNA relatedness for most X. fastidiosa strains
      was *70%. However, at high stringency (Tm -8 degrees C), three distinct genotypes
      (A, B, and C) were revealed. Taxon A included strains from cultivated grape,
      alfalfa, almond (two), and maple, interrelated by 85% (mean); taxon B included
      strains from peach, elm, plum, pigeon grape, sycamore, and almond (one),
      interrelated by 84%; and taxon C included only strains from citrus, interrelated 
      by 87%. The mean reciprocal relatedness between taxons A and B, A and C, and B
      and C, were 58, 41, and 45%, respectively. ITS results also indicated the same
      grouping; taxons A and B, A and C, and B and C had identities of 98.7, 97.9, and 
      99.2%, respectively. Previous and present phenotypic data supports the molecular 
      data. Taxon A strains grow faster on Pierce's disease agar medium whereas B and C
      strains grow more slowly. Taxon B and C strains are susceptible to penicillin and
      resistant to carbenicillin whereas A strains are opposite. Each taxon can be
      differentiated serologically as well as by structural proteins. We propose taxons
      A, B, and C be named X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa [correction] subsp. nov,
      subsp. multiplex, subsp. nov., and subsp. pauca, subsp. nov., respectively. The
      type strains of the subspecies are subsp. fastidiosa [correction] ICPB 50025 (=
      ATTC 35879T and ICMP 15197), subsp. multiplex ICPB 50039 (= ATTC 35871 and ICMP
      15199), and subsp. pauca ICPB 50031 (= ICMP 15198).

TI  - The DNA sequence and comparative analysis of human chromosome 10.
PG  - 375-81
AB  - The finished sequence of human chromosome 10 comprises a total of 131,666,441
      base pairs. It represents 99.4% of the euchromatic DNA and includes one megabase 
      of heterochromatic sequence within the pericentromeric region of the short and
      long arm of the chromosome. Sequence annotation revealed 1,357 genes, of which
      816 are protein coding, and 430 are pseudogenes. We observed widespread
      occurrence of overlapping coding genes (either strand) and identified 67
      antisense transcripts. Our analysis suggests that both inter- and
      intrachromosomal segmental duplications have impacted on the gene count on
      chromosome 10. Multispecies comparative analysis indicated that we can readily
      annotate the protein-coding genes with current resources. We estimate that over
      95% of all coding exons were identified in this study. Assessment of single base 
      changes between the human chromosome 10 and chimpanzee sequence revealed nonsense
      mutations in only 21 coding genes with respect to the human sequence.

TI  - DNA sequence and analysis of human chromosome 9.
PG  - 369-74
AB  - Chromosome 9 is highly structurally polymorphic. It contains the largest
      autosomal block of heterochromatin, which is heteromorphic in 6-8% of humans,
      whereas pericentric inversions occur in more than 1% of the population. The
      finished euchromatic sequence of chromosome 9 comprises 109,044,351 base pairs
      and represents >99.6% of the region. Analysis of the sequence reveals many intra-
      and interchromosomal duplications, including segmental duplications adjacent to
      both the centromere and the large heterochromatic block. We have annotated 1,149 
      genes, including genes implicated in male-to-female sex reversal, cancer and
      neurodegenerative disease, and 426 pseudogenes. The chromosome contains the
      largest interferon gene cluster in the human genome. There is also a region of
      exceptionally high gene and G + C content including genes paralogous to those in 
      the major histocompatibility complex. We have also detected recently duplicated
      genes that exhibit different rates of sequence divergence, presumably reflecting 
      natural selection.

TI  - The effect of tobacco blend additives on the retention of nicotine and solanesol 
      in the human respiratory tract and on subsequent plasma nicotine concentrations
      during cigarette smoking.
PG  - 537-44
AB  - The influence of the tobacco additives diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP) and
      urea on the delivery and respiratory tract retention of nicotine and solanesol
      and on the uptake of nicotine into venous blood was investigated in 10 smokers
      under mouth-hold and 75 and 500 mL inhalation conditions. Three cigarettes with
      identical physical specifications were produced from a common lamina tobacco
      blend. The control cigarette contained nonammoniated reconstituted tobacco sheet 
      (RTS), whereas DAP and other ammonia compounds were added to the RTS of the
      second cigarette. Urea was added to the tobacco of the third cigarette. The
      presence of DAP or urea in the test cigarettes did not significantly influence
      solanesol retention within the mouth during the mouth-hold condition. Nicotine
      retention within the mouth during the mouth-hold condition was, however,
      significantly higher for the DAP cigarette (64.3 +/- 10.5%) than for the urea
      (53.3 +/- 11.3%) or control cigarette (46.3 +/- 8.6%), but this did not result in
      an increase in nicotine uptake into venous blood. Solanesol retentions during the
      75 and 500 mL inhalation volume conditions and nicotine retentions during the 75 
      mL inhalation volume condition were not significantly different for the three
      cigarette types. Although the nicotine retention approached 100% with each
      cigarette type during the 500 mL inhalation condition, the nicotine retention for
      the urea-treated cigarette (99.6 +/- 0.2%) was marginally, but statistically,
      significant, higher than for the control (99.1 +/- 0.5%) and DAP-treated
      cigarettes (98.8 +/- 0.6%). There were no statistically significant differences
      between the indices of nicotine uptake into venous blood for the three cigarette 
      types in any of the inhalation conditions.

TI  - The DNA sequence and analysis of human chromosome 13.
PG  - 522-8
AB  - Chromosome 13 is the largest acrocentric human chromosome. It carries genes
      involved in cancer including the breast cancer type 2 (BRCA2) and retinoblastoma 
      (RB1) genes, is frequently rearranged in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,
      and contains the DAOA locus associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
      We describe completion and analysis of 95.5 megabases (Mb) of sequence from
      chromosome 13, which contains 633 genes and 296 pseudogenes. We estimate that
      more than 95.4% of the protein-coding genes of this chromosome have been
      identified, on the basis of comparison with other vertebrate genome sequences.
      Additionally, 105 putative non-coding RNA genes were found. Chromosome 13 has one
      of the lowest gene densities (6.5 genes per Mb) among human chromosomes, and
      contains a central region of 38 Mb where the gene density drops to only 3.1 genes
      per Mb.

TI  - The relationship between computer testing during a nursing program and NCLEX
      performance.
PG  - 326-9
AB  - Computerized testing for the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX)
      became available in April 1994. In an effort to assist students in becoming more 
      comfortable with taking the licensure examination by computer, faculty in the
      author's school of nursing initiated computer-based testing in selected nursing
      courses. This article reports the results from 7 years of data on the relation
      between computer-based testing during a Bachelor of Science in Nursing program
      and subsequent performance on the NCLEX examination. Student cohort pass rates on
      the NCLEX for the 4 years before the administration of course computer-based
      testing were compared with those for the 3 years after the course computer-based 
      testing strategy was implemented. The results show no significant differences in 
      NCLEX pass rates between the students who were exposed to computer-based testing 
      in their nursing program and those who were not exposed. The implications of
      these findings are discussed.

TI  - The role of computed tomographic scans in the management of the N-positive neck
      in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma after chemoradiotherapy.
PG  - 74-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomographic
      (CT) scanning in predicting residual cervical metastatic disease (N-positive
      neck) in patients undergoing curative radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy for
      squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the upper aerodigestive tract. DESIGN:
      Retrospective case series (1995-2002) of patients undergoing radiotherapy and
      chemoradiotherapy for advanced head and neck SCC. METHODS: Study entry criteria
      included N-positive neck disease, a complete response to treatment at the primary
      tumor site, posttreatment CT scan, posttreatment neck dissection, and correlation
      of posttreatment CT scan with pathologic neck specimen. We calculated the
      sensitivity and specificity of the CT scan to predict the presence of residual
      cervical metastatic disease after curative radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy.
      RESULTS: Forty-three patients (including 10 with bilateral N-positive necks) met 
      the study criteria for analysis. Twenty (38%) of the 53 neck dissection specimens
      were positive for residual cervical metastatic disease. The sensitivity of the CT
      scan was 85%, while the specificity was only 24%. The positive predictive value
      of the CT scan was 40%. CONCLUSIONS: While the role of the posttreatment neck
      dissection remains controversial, the surgeon must rely on clinical examination
      and imaging studies. Our practice has been to perform planned staged neck
      dissections on all N2/N3 necks as well as N1 necks with an incomplete response to
      treatment. Based on our results, it appears that the CT scan technique lacks
      adequate sensitivity and specificity to reliably predict the presence of residual
      metastatic disease.

TI  - Fusicoccin induces in plant cells a programmed cell death showing apoptotic
      features.
PG  - 113-6
AB  - Programmed cell death plays a pivotal role in several developmental processes of 
      plants and it is involved in the response to environmental stresses and in the
      defense mechanisms against pathogen attack. It has not yet been defined which
      part of the death signalling mechanism and which molecules involved in programmed
      cell death are common to animals and plants. In this paper we show that
      fusicoccin, a well-known phytotoxin, induces a strong acceleration in the
      appearance of Evans Blue-stainable (dead) cells in sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus 
      L.) cultures. This fusicoccin-induced cell death shows aspects common to the form
      of animal programmed cell death termed apoptosis: i.e., cell shrinkage, changes
      in nucleus morphology, increase in DNA fragmentation detectable by a specific
      immunological reaction, and presence of oligonucleosomal-size fragments
      (laddering) in DNA gel electrophoresis. Since fusicoccin has a well-identified
      molecular target, the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase, and thoroughly investigated
      physiological effects, this toxin appears to be a useful tool to study the
      transduction of death signals leading to programmed cell death in plants.

TI  - The DNA sequence and analysis of human chromosome 6.
PG  - 805-11
AB  - Chromosome 6 is a metacentric chromosome that constitutes about 6% of the human
      genome. The finished sequence comprises 166,880,988 base pairs, representing the 
      largest chromosome sequenced so far. The entire sequence has been subjected to
      high-quality manual annotation, resulting in the evidence-supported
      identification of 1,557 genes and 633 pseudogenes. Here we report that at least
      96% of the protein-coding genes have been identified, as assessed by
      multi-species comparative sequence analysis, and provide evidence for the
      presence of further, otherwise unsupported exons/genes. Among these are genes
      directly implicated in cancer, schizophrenia, autoimmunity and many other
      diseases. Chromosome 6 harbours the largest transfer RNA gene cluster in the
      genome; we show that this cluster co-localizes with a region of high
      transcriptional activity. Within the essential immune loci of the major
      histocompatibility complex, we find HLA-B to be the most polymorphic gene on
      chromosome 6 and in the human genome.

TI  - Duties to stakeholders amidst pressures from shareholders: lessons from an
      advisory panel on transplant policy.
PG  - 319-40
AB  - The distinction between stakeholders and shareholders frequently employed in
      business ethics can illuminate challenges faced by a bioethics advisory panel. I 
      use the distinction to reflect back on the work of an advisory panel on which I
      served, a panel on US transplant policy. The panel hearings were akin to a
      shareholders' meeting, with many stakeholders absent. In addition to 'hearing
      out' the shareholders who were present, the panel had duties to absent
      stakeholders to insure their interests were included in public discussion. While 
      panel efforts to include stakeholder perspectives rightfully framed its report,
      such duties should have framed its operating procedures more robustly. The
      stakeholder/shareholder distinction also offers a critical prism on the actual
      evolution of organ allocation policy, which the panel failed to influence.
      Current policy embodies a compromise among shareholders that obscures major
      stakeholder interests. This results in under-attention to likely medical benefit 
      of transplant, compared to other allocation criteria. Recognition of duties to
      stakeholders amidst pressures of shareholders complicates the notion of
      'consensus' for an advisory panel. Consensus framed on terms defined only by
      shareholders, not stakeholders, may be an inadequate measure of public interest.

TI  - Noise in the ambulatory health care setting. How loud is too loud?
PG  - 243-9
AB  - A study was conducted to assess noise levels at the Sycamore Primary Care Center,
      an ambulatory health care facility. It is hypothesized that the building design
      led to an unusually quiet environment. Noise levels were sampled over a two-week 
      period at two locations within the center, with a range of between 49.2 and 53.2 
      decibels. A comprehensive literature review failed to find comparison data at
      other ambulatory care facilities. However, when comparing the results to those of
      a typical business office environment, the building is unusually quiet. This
      should result in a positive environment for employees, by increasing productivity
      and reducing stress.

TI  - The effect of mirthful laughter on stress and natural killer cell activity.
PG  - 38-45
AB  - CONTEXT: A recent survey of rural Midwestern cancer patients revealed that humor 
      was one of the most frequently used complementary therapies.
      Psychoneuroimmunology research suggests that, in addition to its established
      psychological benefits, humor may have physiological effects on immune
      functioning. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of laughter on self-reported
      stress and natural killer cell activity. DESIGN: Randomized, pre-post test with
      comparison group. SETTING: Indiana State University Sycamore Nursing Center,
      which is a nurse-managed community health clinic in a mid-sized, Midwestern city.
      PARTICIPANTS: 33 healthy adult women. INTERVENTION: Experimental subjects viewed 
      a humorous video while subjects in the distraction control group viewed a tourism
      video. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported stress and arousal (Stress Arousal
      Check List), mirthful laughter (Humor Response Scale), and immune function
      (chromium release natural killer [NK] cell cytotoxicity assay). RESULTS: Stress
      decreased for subjects in the humor group, compared with those in the distraction
      group (U32 = 215.5; P = .004). Amount of mirthful laughter correlated with
      postintervention stress measures for persons in the humor group (r16 = -.655; P =
      .004). Subjects who scored greater than 25 on the humor response scale had
      increased immune function postintervention (t16 = 2.52 P = .037) and compared
      with the remaining participants (t32 = 32.1; P = .04). Humor response scale
      scores correlated with changes in NK cell activity (r16 = .744; P = 001).
      CONCLUSION: Laughter may reduce stress and improve NK cell activity. As low NK
      cell activity is linked to decreased disease resistance and increased morbidity
      in persons with cancer and HIV disease, laughter may be a useful
      cognitive-behavioral intervention.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen transfer from a desert stream to riparian predators.
PG  - 238-50
AB  - Adult aquatic insects emerging from streams may be a significant source of energy
      for terrestrial predators inhabiting riparian zones. In this study, we use
      natural abundance delta(13)C and delta(15)N values and an isotopic (15)N tracer
      addition to quantify the flow of carbon and nitrogen from aquatic to terrestrial 
      food webs via emerging aquatic insects. We continuously dripped labeled
      (15)N-NH(4) for 6 weeks into Sycamore Creek, a Sonoran desert stream in the Tonto
      National Forest (central Arizona) and traced the flow of tracer (15)N from the
      stream into spiders living in the riparian zone. After correcting for natural
      abundance delta(15)N, we used isotopic mixing models to calculate the proportion 
      of (15)N from emerging aquatic insects incorporated into spider biomass. Natural 
      abundance delta(13)C values indicate that orb-web weaving spiders inhabiting
      riparian vegetation along the stream channel obtain almost 100% of their carbon
      from instream sources, whereas ground-dwelling hunting spiders obtain on average 
      68% of their carbon from instream sources. During the 6-week period of the (15)N 
      tracer addition, orb-web weaving spiders obtained on average 39% of their
      nitrogen from emerging aquatic insects, whereas spider species hunting on the
      ground obtained on average 25% of their nitrogen from emerging aquatic insects.
      To determine if stream subsidies might be influencing the spatial distribution of
      terrestrial predators, we measured the biomass, abundance and diversity of
      spiders along a gradient from the active stream channel to a distance of 50 m
      into the upland using pitfall traps and timed sweep net samples. Spider
      abundance, biomass and richness were highest within the active stream channel but
      decreased more than three-fold 25 m from the wetted stream margin. Changes in
      structural complexity of vegetation, ground cover or terrestrial prey abundance
      could not account for patterns in spider distributions, however nutrient and
      energy subsidies from the stream could explain elevated spider numbers and
      richness within the active stream channel and riparian zone of Sycamore Creek.

TI  - The roles and rules of law in sexual development.
PG  - 46-50
AB  - This article provides an overview of the diverse sources of law that regulate
      sexual development and its resulting behaviors, dispositions, and outcomes. After
      exploring how the law influences sexuality by regulating families, schools,
      media, and social service delivery, the article examines the role of criminal and
      civil law in regulating partners influences on sexual relationships. The article 
      then briefly analyses how the law influences the manner individuals themselves
      influence their intimate relationships and social environments. The article
      emphasizes that the necessary brevity of the overview masks many complexities but
      that existing laws and trends highlight how the law plays a dominant role in our 
      lives, how the law seeks to promote certain dispositions, that the law must be
      harnessed to foster healthy relationships, and that contending with the law s
      dictates provides social scientists with important opportunities to foster social
      reform and structure healthy, supportive social environments conducive to
      responsible behaviors, attitudes, and dispositions.

TI  - The major tasks of adolescence: Implications for transition planning with youths 
      with cerebral palsy.
PG  - 51-58
AB  - Adolescents with cerebral palsy are presented with unique challenges as they make
      the transition to adulthood. There are a number of considerations that need to be
      addressed in a collaborative manner by rehabilitation professionals, educators,
      parents, and adolescents to facilitate the transition process. This article (a)
      explores the challenges that youths with cerebral palsy encounter as they attempt
      to accomplish the developmental tasks of adolescence and (b) discusses how those 
      tasks can be integrated into transition planning. An overview of the medical
      aspects of cerebral palsy is also provided.

TI  - Effects of cadmium on cation concentrations in sycamore cells (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.): application of EDXRF.
PG  - 827-9
AB  - Knowledge of the element content of biological systems is important in enabling
      understanding of uptake mechanisms and physiological response to stress
      conditions. In this work concentrations of mineral elements in sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.) cells grown in the presence of cadmium have been analysed and 
      compared with concentrations in control cells. Energy-dispersive X-ray
      fluorescence (EDXRF) was used to quantify the nutrients K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn
      present in the cells. The reproducibility and accuracy of the technique were
      demonstrated by analysis of biological reference materials. Exposure of sycamore 
      cells to cadmium had induced variation in the content of some elements. Mn, Cu,
      Zn, and, particularly, Fe concentrations in cells exposed to Cd were higher than 
      those found in control cells. Ca is adsorbed on the cell walls and the
      concentration of K is not affected by the presence of Cd.

TI  - Historical changes in lead concentrations in tree-rings of sycamore, oak and
      Scots pine in north-west England.
PG  - 85-96
AB  - Lead concentrations in tree rings of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), oak
      (Quercus robur L.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sampled at a parkland in 
      north-west England were measured in wood formed since the mid-1800s.
      Concentrations of Pb in Scots pine and oak peaked in wood formed between 1900 and
      1940, most likely because of Pb accumulation in heartwood, indicating that oak
      and Scots pine are unsuitable for monitoring temporal changes in Pb deposition at
      the study site. In contrast, Pb concentrations in sycamore, a species that has
      similar heartwood and sapwood chemistry, were relatively constant in wood formed 
      between the mid-1800s and 1950. Lead concentrations decreased steadily in
      sycamore tree rings formed after the 1950s, and decreased more abruptly in wood
      formed after 1985. This sharp decrease in wood Pb cannot be due to decreases in
      soil Pb concentration. Stable Pb isotope analysis was used to further investigate
      Pb patterns in sycamore wood. Excess 206Pb/207Pb ratios in tree-rings of sycamore
      were relatively constant, approximately 1.17, in wood formed prior to the 1930s, 
      but decreased steadily thereafter reaching a minimum value of approximately 1.16 
      in wood formed between 1975 and 1985 after which time 206Pb/207Pb ratios
      increased. This pattern is consistent with changes in Pb isotope ratios measured 
      in peat, sediment and aerosol samples in the UK. However, the magnitude of the
      decrease in 206Pb/207Pb (largely due to gasoline Pb) is considerably lower than
      in other studies and our estimates indicate that less than 20% of the total Pb in
      sycamore wood measured since the mid-1800s is derived from gasoline emissions. A 
      more likely explanation for the pattern of Pb observed in sycamore tree rings is 
      that soil Pb accumulates within rings of the diffuse porous wood over a number of
      years. Such uptake patterns would result in lower Pb concentrations in the outer 
      (more recently formed) tree rings, which coincide with recent reductions in Pb
      deposition in the UK. Overall, this study indicates that tree ring chemistry is
      unsuitable for monitoring historical changes in Pb deposition at the study site.

TI  - The DNA sequence and comparative analysis of human chromosome 20.
PG  - 865-71
AB  - The finished sequence of human chromosome 20 comprises 59,187,298 base pairs (bp)
      and represents 99.4% of the euchromatic DNA. A single contig of 26 megabases (Mb)
      spans the entire short arm, and five contigs separated by gaps totalling 320 kb
      span the long arm of this metacentric chromosome. An additional 234,339 bp of
      sequence has been determined within the pericentromeric region of the long arm.
      We annotated 727 genes and 168 pseudogenes in the sequence. About 64% of these
      genes have a 5' and a 3' untranslated region and a complete open reading frame.
      Comparative analysis of the sequence of chromosome 20 to whole-genome
      shotgun-sequence data of two other vertebrates, the mouse Mus musculus and the
      puffer fish Tetraodon nigroviridis, provides an independent measure of the
      efficiency of gene annotation, and indicates that this analysis may account for
      more than 95% of all coding exons and almost all genes.

TI  - Tunicamycin and Brefeldin A induce in plant cells a programmed cell death showing
      apoptotic features.
PG  - 31-8
AB  - The recent identification of DAD (defender against apoptotic death) gene in
      plants suggests that the N-linked glycosylation of proteins could be an important
      control point of plant programmed cell death. In this paper we describe the
      effects of Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked protein glycosylation, and
      Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of protein trafficking from the Golgi apparatus, on
      sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cell cultures. These two chemicals proved able 
      to induce a strong acceleration of the cell death; changes in cell and nucleus
      morphology; an increase in DNA fragmentation, detectable by a specific
      immunological reaction; and the presence of oligonucleosomal-size fragments
      (laddering) in DNA gel electrophoresis. Moreover, Brefeldin A, but not
      Tunicamycin, strongly stimulated the production of hydrogen peroxide. These
      results indicate that also in plants chemicals interfering with the activities of
      endoplasmic reticulum and of Golgi apparatus strongly induce a form of programmed
      cell death showing apoptotic features.

TI  - Transforming echoes into pseudo-action potentials for classifying plants.
PG  - 2198-206
AB  - Animals perceive their environment by converting sensory stimuli into action
      potentials, or temporal point processes, that are interpreted by the brain. This 
      paper investigates the information content of point processes extracted from
      echoes from in situ plants in an effort to understand how bats recognize
      landmarks in the field. A mobile sonar converts echoes into biologically similar 
      temporal point processes. termed pseudo-action potentials (PAPs), whose inter-PAP
      interval relates to echo amplitude. The sonar forms a sector scan of an object to
      produce a spatial-temporal PAP field. Classifier neurons apply delays and
      coincidence detection to the PAP field to identify three distinct echo types,
      glints, blobs, and fuzz, which characterize plant features. Glints are large
      amplitude echoes exhibiting coherence over successive echoes in the sector scan, 
      typically produced by favorably oriented isolated specular reflectors. Blobs are 
      large echoes lacking coherence, typically bordering glints or formed by
      collections of interfering reflectors. Fuzz represents weak echoes, typically
      produced by collection of weak scatterers or by reflectors on the beam periphery.
      A small mirror reflector models a flat leaf surface and motivates the glint
      criteria. Classifiers are applied to experimental data from two types of tree
      trunks, a glint-producing sycamore (Platanus occidenatalis) and a glint-absent
      Norway maple (Acer platanoides) and two plants, a glint-producing rhododendron
      (Rhododendron maximus) and a glint-absent yew (Taxus media). We speculate that
      our narrow-band sonar models the activity of a single frequency bin in the
      frequency-modulated (FM) sweep emitted by bats, and that one function of the
      frequency bins in the FM sweep is to form a sector scan of the environment.

TI  - Testing a process-based model of tree seedling growth by manipulating.
PG  - 993-1005
AB  - A model was developed that simulated photosynthesis, growth and allocation in
      tree seedlings. The model was parameterized with data from experiments on
      seedlings of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis
      (Bong) Carr.) and young birch trees (Betula pendula Roth.). In these experiments,
      CO2 concentration ([CO2]) and nutrient addition rate were varied. Parameters
      quantifying nutrient uptake, translocation and starch synthesis were fitted,
      based on data from control treatments. Elevated [CO2] and low-nutrient treatments
      were then used to test the predicted response of growth and allocation against
      observations. The model accurately predicted total seedling growth in the
      elevated [CO2] treatments. A response of growth to elevated [CO2] was seen in the
      birch and sycamore experiments, but not in the Sitka spruce, because of
      photosynthetic down-regulation. Predictions of allocation were reasonably
      accurate in the birch and Sitka spruce experiments, but were notably poorer in
      the sycamore experiments, possibly because of differences in sink strength
      between root and shoot. In the birch and sycamore experiments, little change in
      allocation with elevated [CO2] was observed or predicted. This was ascribed to
      the relative values of K(Tc) and K(Tn), the translocation coefficients that
      determine the sensitivity of allocation to carbon and nitrogen uptake rates,
      respectively. Growth and allocation in the low-nutrient treatments were poorly
      predicted by the model. In Sitka spruce, it was suspected that the photosynthetic
      parameters measured in August 1994 had been higher earlier in the season, before 
      nutrients became depleted. In sycamore, the discrepancies were thought to relate 
      to differences in sink strength between root and shoot that could not be
      described by the model.

TI  - Plants as biomarkers for monitoring heavy metal contaminants on landfill sites
      using sequential extraction and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
      spectrophotometry (ICP-AES).
PG  - 621-7
AB  - There have been a number of studies investigating metal uptake in plants on
      contaminated landfill sites, but little on their role as biomarkers to identify
      metal mobility for continuous monitoring purposes. Vegetation can be used as a
      biomonitor of site pollution, by identifying the mobilisation of heavy metals and
      by providing an understanding of their bioavailability. Plants selected were the 
      common nettle (Uritica Dioica), bramble (Rubus Fruticosa) and sycamore (Acer
      Pseudoplatanus). A study of the soil fractionation was made to investigate the
      soil properties that are likely to influence metal mobility and a correlation
      exercise was undertaken to investigate if variations in concentration of metals
      in vegetation can reflect variations in concentration of the metals in soil. The 
      soil was digested using aqua regia in a microwave closed vessel. The vegetation
      was digested using both microwave and a hydrogen peroxide-nitric acid mixture,
      refluxed on a heating block and a comparison made. The certified reference
      materials (CRMs) used were Standard Reference Material (SRM) 1547, peach leaves
      for vegetation (NIST) and for soil CRM 143R, sewage sludge-amended soil (BCR).
      The relative standard deviations (RSDs) were 2-6% for the analyses. Our findings 
      show evidence of phytoextraction by some plants, (especially bramble and nettle),
      with certain plants, (sycamore) exhibiting signs of phytostabilisation. The
      evidence suggests that there is a degree of selectivity in metal uptake and
      partitioning within the plant compartments. It was also possible to correlate
      mobility phases of certain metals (Pb, Cu and Zn) using the soil and plant
      record. Zn and Cu exhibited the greatest potential to migrate from the roots to
      the leaves, with Pb found principally in the roots of ground vegetation. Our
      results suggest that analysis of bramble leaves, nettle leaves and roots can be
      used to monitor the mobility of Pb in the soil with nettle, bramble and sycamore 
      leaves to monitor Cu and Zn.

TI  - Origin of the cytoplasmic pH changes during anaerobic stress in higher plant
      cells. Carbon-13 and phosphorous-31 nuclear magnetic resonance studies.
PG  - 912-25
AB  - We tested the contribution of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis, ethanol, 
      and organic acid syntheses, and H(+)-pump ATPases activity in the acidosis of
      anoxic sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) plant cells. Culture cells were chosen to
      alter NTP pools and fermentation with specific nutrient media (phosphate
      [Pi]-deprived and adenine- or glycerol-supplied). In vivo (31)P- and
      (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was utilized to noninvasively
      measure intracellular pHs, Pi, phosphomonoesters, nucleotides, lactate, and
      ethanol. Following the onset of anoxia, cytoplasmic (cyt) pH (7.5) decreased to
      6.8 within 4 to 5 min, whereas vacuolar pH (5.7) and external pH (6.5) remained
      stable. The NTP pool simultaneously decreased from 210 to <20 nmol g(-1) cell wet
      weight, whereas nuceloside diphosphate, nucleoside monophosphate, and cyt pH
      increased correspondingly. The initial cytoplasmic acidification was at a minimum
      in Pi-deprived cells containing little NTP, and at a maximum in adenine-incubated
      cells showing the highest NTP concentration. Our data show that the release of
      H(+) ions accompanying the Pi-liberating hydrolysis of NTP was the principal
      cause of the initial cyt pH drop and that this cytoplasmic acidosis was not
      overcome by H(+) extrusion. After 15 min of anoxia, a partial cyt-pH recovery
      observed in cells supplied with Glc, but not with glycerol, was attributed to the
      H(+)-consuming ATP synthesis accompanying ethanolic fermentation. Following
      re-oxygenation, the cyt pH recovered its initial value (7.5) within 2 to 3 min,
      whereas external pH decreased abruptly. We suggest that the H(+)-pumping ATPase
      located in the plasma membrane was blocked in anoxia and quickly reactivated
      after re-oxygenation.

TI  - Distinct isoforms of ADPglucose pyrophosphatase and ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase 
      occur in the suspension-cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.).
PG  - 277-82
AB  - The intracellular localizations of ADPglucose pyrophosphatase (AGPPase) and
      ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) have been studied using protoplasts
      prepared from suspension-cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.).
      Subcellular fractionation studies revealed that all the AGPPase present in the
      protoplasts is associated with amyloplasts, whereas more than 60% of AGPase is in
      the extraplastidial compartment. Immunoblots of amyloplast- and
      extraplastid-enriched extracts further confirmed that AGPase is located mainly
      outside the amyloplast. Experiments carried out to identify possible different
      isoforms of AGPPase in the amyloplast revealed the presence of soluble and starch
      granule-bound isoforms. We thus propose that ADPglucose levels linked to starch
      biosynthesis in sycamore cells are controlled by enzymatic reactions catalyzing
      the synthesis and breakdown of ADPglucose, which take place both inside and
      outside the amyloplast.

TI  - Adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphatase: A plastidial phosphodiesterase
      that prevents starch biosynthesis.
PG  - 8705-10
AB  - A distinct phosphodiesterasic activity (EC 3.1.4) was found in both mono- and
      dicotyledonous plants that catalyzes the hydrolytic breakdown of ADPglucose
      (ADPG) to produce equimolar amounts of glucose-1-phosphate and AMP. The enzyme
      responsible for this activity, referred to as ADPG pyrophosphatase (AGPPase), was
      purified over 1,100-fold from barley leaves and subjected to biochemical
      characterization. The calculated K(eq)' (modified equilibrium constant) value for
      the ADPG hydrolytic reaction at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C is 110, and its
      standard-state free-energy change value (DeltaG') is -2.9 kcal/mol (1 kcal = 4.18
      kJ). Kinetic analyses showed that, although AGPPase can hydrolyze several
      low-molecular weight phosphodiester bond-containing compounds, ADPG proved to be 
      the best substrate (K(m) = 0.5 mM). P(i) and phosphorylated compounds such as
      3-phosphoglycerate, PP(i), ATP, ADP, NADP(+), and AMP are inhibitors of AGPPase. 
      Subcellular localization studies revealed that AGPPase is localized exclusively
      in the plastidial compartment of cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus 
      L.), whereas it occurs both inside and outside the plastid in barley endosperm.
      In this paper, evidence is presented that shows that AGPPase, whose activity
      declines concomitantly with the accumulation of starch during development of sink
      organs, competes with starch synthase (ADPG:1,4-alpha-d-glucan
      4-alpha-d-glucosyltransferase; EC) for ADPG, thus markedly blocking the starch
      biosynthesis.

TI  - Metabolism of methanol in plant cells. Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance
      studies.
PG  - 287-96
AB  - Using (13)C-NMR, we demonstrate that [(13)C]methanol readily entered sycamore
      (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells to be slowly metabolized to [3-(13)C]serine,
      [(13)CH(3)]methionine, and [(13)CH(3)]phosphatidylcholine. We conclude that the
      assimilation of [(13)C]methanol occurs through the formation of
      (13)CH(3)H(4)Pte-glutamate (Glu)(n) and S-adenosyl-methionine, because feeding
      plant cells with [3-(13)CH(3)]serine, the direct precursor of
      (13)CH(2)H(4)Pte-Glu(n), can perfectly mimic [(13)CH(3)]methanol for
      folate-mediated single-carbon metabolism. On the other hand, the metabolism of
      [(13)C]methanol in plant cells revealed assimilation of label into a new cellular
      product that was identified as [(13)CH(3)]methyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside. The de
      novo synthesis of methyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside induced by methanol did not
      require the formation of (13)CH(3)H(4)Pte-Glu(n) and was very likely catalyzed by
      a "transglycosylation" process.

      oligosaccharide produced by cultured rose cells
PG  - 150-6
AB  - A non-reducing trisaccharide, alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1 -->
      4)-alpha-D-glucuronopyranosyl-(1 --> 2)-myo-inositol (MGI) accumulated in the
      spent medium of cell-suspension cultures of 'Paul's Scarlet' rose (Rosa sp.)
      predominantly during the period of rapid cell growth. This trisaccharide was also
      produced by cultures of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) but not by those of the
      graminaceous monocots maize (Zea mays L.) and tall fescue grass (Festuca
      arundinacea Schreb.). When added to cultured Rosa cells, [(14)C]MGI was neither
      taken up by the cells nor bound to the cell surface and was not metabolised
      extracellularly. When D-[6-(14)C]glucuronic acid was fed to cultured Rosa cells, 
      extracellular [(14)C]MGI started to appear only after a 5-h lag period, compared 
      with a 0.5-h lag period for labelling of extracelluar polysaccharides.
      Furthermore, [(14)C]MGI continued to accumulate in the medium for at least 20 h
      after the accumulation of (14)C-polymers had ceased. These observations indicate 
      that extracellular MGI was produced from a slowly turning-over pool of a
      pre-formed intermediate. Structural considerations indicate that the intermediate
      could be a glucuronomannan or a phytoglycolipid (glycophosphosphingolipid). No
      Rosa polysaccharides could be found that generated MGI in the presence of living 
      Rosa cells. We therefore favour phytoglycolipids as the probable biosynthetic
      origin of MGI.

TI  - Glycine and serine catabolism in non-photosynthetic higher plant cells: their
      role in C1 metabolism.
PG  - 197-205
AB  - Glycine and serine are two interconvertible amino acids that play an important
      role in C1 metabolism. Using 13C NMR and various 13C-labelled substrates, we
      studied the catabolism of each of these amino acids in non-photosynthetic
      sycamore cambial cells. On one hand, we observed a rapid glycine catabolism that 
      involved glycine oxidation by the mitochondrial glycine decarboxylase (GDC)
      system. The methylenetetra- hydrofolate (CH2-THF) produced during this reaction
      did not equilibrate with the overall CH2-THF pool, but was almost totally
      recycled by the mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) for the
      synthesis of one serine from a second molecule of glycine. Glycine, in contrast
      to serine, was a poor source of C1 units for the synthesis of methionine. On the 
      other hand, catabolism of serine was about three times lower than catabolism of
      glycine. Part of this catabolism presumably involved the glycolytic pathway.
      However, the largest part (about two-thirds) involved serine-to-glycine
      conversion by cytosolic SHMT, then glycine oxidation by GDC. The availability of 
      cytosolic THF for the initial SHMT reaction is possibly the limiting factor of
      this catabolic pathway. These data support the view that serine catabolism in
      plants is essentially connected to C1 metabolism. The glycine formed during this 
      process is rapidly oxidized by the mitochondrial GDC-SHMT enzymatic system, which
      is therefore required in all plant tissues.

AB  - Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) using CO(2) and solid-phase extraction (SPE)
      are two technologies recently discussed in the literature as alternatives to
      Soxhlet and liquid/liquid extraction (LLE). This research compared SFE and SPE
      extraction efficiency of two imidazolinone herbicides, AC263,222 and imazethapyr,
      from three soils. Recovery of the herbicides using SFE-CO(2) with a 4.6:1
      acetonitrile:acetic acid cosolvent was approximately 80% for Poth and Tremona
      soils and 60% when extracted from Ships soil with high clay content and high pH. 
      SPE recovery of both herbicides averaged 78% and was not statistically different 
      between soils. Combining SPE disks with a SPE cartridge cleanup procedure
      provided a faster filtration with cleaner filtrate compared with using SPE C-18
      cartridges by themselves. Cleanup was needed after both SFE and SPE disk
      extraction due to interfering peaks in the chromatography.

TI  - An investigation of primary care patients receiving extended treatment with

PG  - 1397-402
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the psychiatric characteristics of a sample of primary
      care patients receiving extended treatment with selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs) as well as to assess the appropriateness of extended
      treatment. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective case series of patients (convenience
      sample) assessed with survey, psychological testing, interview, and medical
      record review. METHODS: Participants (n = 39) were patients in a health
      maintenance organization primary care setting receiving treatment with SSRI-type 
      antidepressants for 12 months or longer, with no psychiatric evaluation or
      treatment immediately before commencement of antidepressant therapy. Each
      participant completed measures of self-destructive behavior and personality
      disturbance, underwent a clinical psychiatric interview, and had their medical
      record reviewed to determine psychiatric diagnoses by the primary care physician 
      at the initiation of antidepressant treatment. RESULTS: On psychiatric interview,
      64.1% of participants were diagnosed with major depression, the majority
      recurrent (46.2% of the entire sample); 46.2% with dysthymia; and 38.5% with
      panic disorder. Psychiatric morbidity in this sample was reflected by recurrent
      depressive episodes, long-standing depression, comorbid psychiatric diagnoses on 
      interview (average of 1.8 diagnoses per participant), self-harm behaviors, and
      personality pathology. Seventy-seven percent of primary care diagnoses gleaned
      from medical records reflected depressive diagnoses. The approximate "match" rate
      for a depression-spectrum diagnosis between psychiatric interviewer and primary
      care physicians was 90%; however, on psychiatric interview, 16.7% of participants
      had bipolar disorder and 38.5% had panic disorder, which were not noted in the
      primary care medical record. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in primary care settings
      receiving extended treatment with SSRIs may have complex psychopathology for
      which long-term antidepressant treatment appears appropriate.

TI  - Rhamnogalacturonan II from cell walls of Cryptomeria japonica.
PG  - 681-90
AB  - The pectic polysaccharides isolated from cell walls of xylem-differentiating
      zones of sugi (Cryptomeria japononica) were degraded with
      endo-alpha-(1-->4)-polygalacturonase and the polysaccharides, composed mainly of 
      rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II), were obtained from the degradation products. These
      polysaccharides consisted of rhamnosyl, fucosyl, arabinosyl, xylosyl, galactosyl,
      glucosyl, galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid and the characteristic sugars of
      RG-II, namely, 2-O-methylfucose, 2-O-methylxylose, apiose, aceric acid and
      thiobarbituric acid assay-positive glycosyl inverted question markprobably,
      3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid (Kdo) and 3-deoxy-D-lyxo-heptulosaric acid
      (Dha) inverted question mark. The polysaccharides contained the glycosyl residues
      of RG-II, besides small amounts of the glycosyl linkages of RG-I. The RG-II was
      structurally analysed by partial acid hydrolysis and lithium treatment in
      ethylenediamine. The glycosyl sequences of three compounds generated by partial
      hydrolysis were not identical to the partial structure of the sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus) RG-I and RG-II structures previously proposed by Albersheim et
      al. Furthermore, five novel glycosyl sequences were detected in the products from
      lithium treatment. The results suggest that the structure of sugi RG-II is
      somewhat different from that of sycamore RG-II.

PG  - 891-7
AB  - The presence of Hsp70 and Hsp60 molecular chaperones in amyloplasts isolated from
      cultured sycamore cells was analyzed by immunoblotting. Hsp70 homologs were
      located in both amyloplast envelope and stromal fractions, but no Hsp60 homologs 
      were detected in any of the different suborganellar fractions. Incubation of
      whole amyloplasts or their envelope fraction with Mg2+ gamma-32P-ATP resulted in 
      a rapid phosphorylation of the envelope-associated Hsp70 homolog, which
      constitutes a major target of phosphorylation in these plastids.

TI  - Transport, Compartmentation, and Metabolism of Homoserine in Higher Plant Cells. 
      Carbon-13- and phosphorus-31-nuclear magnetic resonance studies Carbon-13- and
      Phosphorus-31-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Studies
PG  - 547-57
AB  - The transport, compartmentation, and metabolism of homoserine was characterized
      in two strains of meristematic higher plant cells, the dicotyledonous sycamore
      (Acer pseudoplatanus) and the monocotyledonous weed Echinochloa colonum.
      Homoserine is an intermediate in the synthesis of the aspartate-derived amino
      acids methionine, threonine (Thr), and isoleucine. Using 13C-nuclear magnetic
      resonance, we showed that homoserine actively entered the cells via a
      high-affinity proton-symport carrier (Km approximately 50-60 mum) at the maximum 
      rate of 8 +/- 0.5 mumol h-1 g-1 cell wet weight, and in competition with serine
      or Thr. We could visualize the compartmentation of homoserine, and observed that 
      it accumulated at a concentration 4 to 5 times higher in the cytoplasm than in
      the large vacuolar compartment. 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance permitted us to
      analyze the phosphorylation of homoserine. When sycamore cells were incubated
      with 100 mum homoserine, phosphohomoserine steadily accumulated in the
      cytoplasmic compartment over 24 h at the constant rate of 0.7 mumol h-1 g-1 cell 
      wet weight, indicating that homoserine kinase was not inhibited in vivo by its
      product, phosphohomoserine. The rate of metabolism of phosphohomoserine was much 
      lower (0.06 mumol h-1 g-1 cell wet weight) and essentially sustained Thr
      accumulation. Similarly, homoserine was actively incorporated by E. colonum
      cells. However, in contrast to what was seen in sycamore cells, large
      accumulations of Thr were observed, whereas the intracellular concentration of
      homoserine remained low, and phosphohomoserine did not accumulate. These
      differences with sycamore cells were attributed to the presence of a higher Thr
      synthase activity in this strain of monocot cells.

PG  - 357-65
AB  - Rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) was isolated from the pectin of the cell wall of
      xylem differentiating zones of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don, gymnosperm) by 
      digesting with endo-alpha-1,4-polygalacturonase followed by gel-permeation
      chromatography. Structure of RG-I was characterized by glycosyl composition and
      glycosyl linkage analyses, partial acid hydrolysis, and lithium (Li)-treatment in
      ethylenediamine. The oligosaccharides produced by partial acid hydrolysis showed 
      the backbone of RG-I to be a disaccharide repeating unit of -->
      4)-alpha-D-GalpA-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->. Arabian and oligogalactosyl side
      chains were attached at O-4 of rhamnosyl residues of the backbone. Glycosyl
      composition and glycosyl linkage analyses suggested that the structures and/or
      the distribution of the arabinan sidechains of sugi RG-I were different from
      those of sycamore (angiosperm) RG-I.

TI  - N-glycans harboring the Lewis a epitope are expressed at the surface of plant
      cells.
PG  - 1411-7
AB  - In plants, N-linked glycans are processed in the Golgi apparatus to complex-type 
      N-glycans of limited size containing a beta(1,2)-xylose and/or an
      alpha(1,3)-fucose residue. Larger mono- and bi-antennary N-linked complex glycans
      have not often been described. This study has re-examined the structure of such
      plant N-linked glycans, and, through both immunological and structural data, it
      is shown that the antennae are composed of Lewis a (Le(a)) antigens, comprising
      the carbohydrate sequence Gal beta 1-3[Fuc alpha 1-4]GlcNAc. Furthermore, a
      fucosyltransferase activity involved in the biosynthesis of this antigen was
      detected in sycamore cells. This is the first characterization in plants of a
      Lewis antigen that is usually found on cell-surface glycoconjugates in mammals
      and involved in recognition and adhesion processes. Le(a)-containing N-linked
      glycans are widely distributed in plants and highly expressed at the cell
      surface, which may suggest a putative function in cell/cell communication.

TI  - Rhamnogalacturonan II from the leaves of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer as a macrophage
      Fc receptor expression-enhancing polysaccharide.
PG  - 239-49
AB  - A complex pectic polysaccharide (GL-4IIb2) has been isolated from the leaves of
      Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, and shown to be a macrophage Fc receptor
      expression-enhancing polysaccharide. The primary structure of GL-4IIb2 was
      elucidated by composition. 1H NMR, methylation, and oligosaccharide analyses.
      GL-4IIb2 consisted of 15 different monosaccharides which included rarely observed
      sugars, such as 2-O-methylfucose, 2-O-methylxylose, apiose,
      3-C-carboxy-5-deoxy-L-xylose (aceric acid, AceA), 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic
      acid (Kdo), and 3-deoxy-D-lyxo-2-heptulosaric acid (Dha). Methylation analysis
      indicated that GL-4IIb2 comprised 34 different glycosyl linkages, such as
      3,4-linked Fuc, 3- and 2,3,4-linked Rha, and 2-linked GlcA, which are
      characteristic of rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II). Sequential degradation using
      partial acid hydrolysis indicated that GL-4IIb2 contained alpha-Rhap-(1-->5)-Kdo 
      and Araf-(1-->5) Dha structural elements, an AceA-containing oligosaccharide, and
      uronic acid-rich oligosaccharide chains in addition to an alpha-(1
      -->4)-galacturono-oligosaccharide chain. FABMS and methylation analyses suggested
      that the AceA-containing oligosaccharide was a nonasaccharide in which terminal
      Rha was additionally attached to position 3 of 2-linked Arap of the
      octasaccharide chain observed in sycamore RG-II. Component sugar and methylation 
      analyses assumed that the uronic acid-rich oligosaccharides possessed a similar
      structural feature as those in sycamore RG-II. GL-4IIb2 had a larger molecular
      mass (11,000) than sycamore RG-II (approximately 5000).

TI  - 7-Dehydrobrefeldin A, a naturally occurring brefeldin A derivative, inhibits
      secretion and causes a cis-to-trans breakdown of Golgi stacks in plant cells.
PG  - 487-92
AB  - 7-Dehydrobrefeldin A (7-oxo-BFA) is a brefeldin A (BFA) analog that, like BFA, is
      a potent phytotoxin of Alternaria carthami, a fungal pathogen of safflower
      (Carthamus tinctorius L.) plants. Both BFA and 7-oxo-BFA have been shown to be
      causal agents of the leaf spot disease of these plants. We have investigated the 
      effects of 7-oxo-BFA on the secretion and the structure of the Golgi stacks of
      sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) suspension-cultured cells to determine
      whether 7-oxo-BFA affects these cells in the same manner as BFA. When applied at 
      10 micrograms/mL for 1 h, 7-oxo-BFA inhibits secretion of proteins by
      approximately 80%, the same value obtained for BFA. However, electron micrographs
      of high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted cells demonstrated that 7-oxo-BFA is a
      more potent disrupter of the Golgi stacks of sycamore maple cells than BFA. In
      cells treated for 1 h with 10 micrograms/mL 7-oxo-BFA, very few Golgi stacks can 
      be discerned. Most of those that are left consist of fewer than three cisternae, 
      all of which stain like trans-Golgi cisternae. They are surrounded by clusters of
      large (150-300 nm in diameter), darkly staining vesicles that are embedded in a
      fine-filamentous, ribosome-excluding matrix. Similarly sized and stained vesicles
      are seen budding from the rims of the residual trans-Golgi cisternae. Both the
      large vesicles and the residual Golgi stack buds stain with anti-xyloglucan
      polysaccharide antibodies. Recovery of Golgi stacks after removal of 7-oxo-BFA
      from 1-h-treated cells takes 2 to 6 h, compared with 1 to 2 h for cells treated
      with BFA. In contrast to 7-oxo-BFA, the BFA breakdown product BFA acid had no
      effect either on secretion or on the secretory apparatus. This is the first
      report, to our knowledge of a BFA analog inhibiting secretion in a eukaryotic
      cell system.

TI  - Rhamnogalacturonan II, a dominant polysaccharide in juices produced by enzymic
      liquefaction of fruits and vegetables.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - Rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II), a small complex pectic polysaccharide, is released
      from apple (Malus domestica), carrot (Daucus carota), and tomato (Solanum
      lycopersicum) by treatment with two commercial liquefying enzyme preparations.
      RG-II was isolated by size-exclusion chromatography from apple, tomato, and
      carrot juices obtained by enzymic liquefaction. All the RG-IIs contained the
      diagnostic sugars, apiose, 2-O-methyl-L-fucose, 2-O-methyl-D-xylose, aceric acid,
      Kdo and Dha. Glycosyl-linkage compositions of the neutral and acidic sugars,
      including aceric acid, were consistent with the hypothetical model described for 
      sycamore RG-II confirming the conservation of RG-II in plants. Thus, when
      pectinolytic enzyme preparations are used to process fruits and vegetables, RG-II
      is released as a main soluble polysaccharide fraction while other pectic
      polysaccharides are heavily degraded.

TI  - Arrest of mitochondrial biogenesis in copper-treated sycamore cells.
PG  - 248-52
AB  - Sycamore suspension cells (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) were grown in the presence of 
      sublethal concentrations of copper (50 microM). During the first 5-6 days of
      treatment, growth was not affected, but cell respiration (coupled and uncoupled) 
      declined to approximately 60% of its normal value. This decline of respiration
      was attributed to a progressive diminution of the number of mitochondria in
      copper-treated cells, based on the demonstration of the concomitant decline of
      (1) cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) and cytochrome aa3 (cytochrome oxidase),
      two specific markers of mitochondrial inner membrane, and (2) fumarase activity, 
      a specific marker of mitochondrial matrix space. In addition, the mitochondria
      extracted from copper-treated cells presented the same properties as those from
      control cells, concerning substrate oxidation, cardiolipin and cytochrome aa3
      contents, and fumarase activity. These results strongly suggest that copper
      triggered an arrest of mitochondrial biogenesis, which preceded cell division
      arrest.

TI  - Monensin-induced redistribution of enzymes and products from Golgi stacks to
      swollen vesicles in plant cells.
PG  - 332-40
AB  - We have tested the hypothesis that monensin treatment of plant cells leads to the
      transfer of Golgi enzymes to the monensin-induced swollen vesicles using sycamore
      maple suspension-cultured cells and immunolabeling techniques. Cells treated for 
      20 and 60 min with 10 microM monensin were labeled with anti-V-H(+)-ATPase,
      anti-xyloglucan (XG) sidechain (CCRC-M1), anti-pectic polysaccharide (JIM7 and
      CCRC-M2), and anti-N-glycan (anti-beta Xyl, and anti-alpha Fuc) antibodies. Our
      results demonstrate that monensin causes most H(+)-ATPase to be displaced from
      the Golgi cisternae (label distribution in control cells: 11% cis, 32% medial,
      57% trans cisternae) to the swollen vesicles, which explains why these vesicles
      remain swollen after detachment from the Golgi/trans Golgi network cisternae. We 
      also show that the content of complete XG molecules (defined by completed
      trisaccharide sidechains) in the swollen vesicles increases 1.5-fold between the 
      20 and 60 min samples, suggestive of the transfer of functional XG backbone and
      sidechain synthesizing enzymes from the trans Golgi compartment to the swollen
      vesicles. In contrast, no increase in either anti-pectin antibody or N-glycan
      antibody labeling of the swollen vesicles was observed between the 20 min and 60 
      min monensin samples. Both of these latter types of molecules depend for their
      synthesis on enzymes located in multiple membrane compartments upstream from the 
      trans Golgi cisternae, which greatly decreases the probability of transfer of
      complete enzyme systems to the swollen vesicles. Thus these latter findings do
      not contradict the anti-H(+)-ATPase and the anti-XG labeling data, which strongly
      support the Golgi enzyme displacement theory.

      comparisons with other laccases and ascorbate oxidases have shown that this new

TI  - N-linked oligosaccharide processing is not necessary for glycoprotein secretion
      in plants.
PG  - 713-9
AB  - The role of N-glycans in the secretion of glycoproteins by suspension-cultured
      sycamore cells was studied. The transport of glycoproteins to the extracellular
      compartment was investigated in the presence of a glycan-processing inhibitor,
      castanospermine. Castanospermine has been selected because it inhibits
      homogeneously glycan maturation in sycamore cells and leads to the accumulation
      of a single immature N-glycan. The structure of this glycan has been identified
      as Glc3Man7GlcNAc2 by labeling experiments, affinity chromatography on
      concanavalin A-Sepharose and proton NMR. In contrast with previous results
      showing that N-glycosylation is a prerequisite for secretion of N-linked
      glycoproteins, this secretion is not affected by the presence of castanospermine.
      As a consequence, the presence of this unprocessed glycan is sufficient for an
      efficient secretion of glycoproteins in the extracellular compartment of
      suspension-cultured sycamore cells.

TI  - Rhamnogalacturonan-II, a pectic polysaccharide in the walls of growing plant
      cell, forms a dimer that is covalently cross-linked by a borate ester. In vitro
      conditions for the formation and hydrolysis of the dimer.
PG  - 22923-30
AB  - Rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) is a structurally complex pectic polysaccharide
      present in the walls of growing plant cells. We now report that RG-II, released
      by endopolygalacturonase treatment of the walls of suspension-cultured sycamore
      cells and etiolated pea stems, exists mainly as a dimer that is cross-linked by a
      borate ester. The borate ester is completely hydrolyzed at room temperature
      within 30 min at pH 1, partially hydrolyzed between pH 2 and 4, and stable above 
      pH 4. The dimer is formed in vitro between pH 2.4 and 6. 2 by treating monomeric 
      RG-II (0.5 mM) with boric acid (1.2 mM); the dimer formed after 24 h at pH 3.4
      and 5.0 accounts for approximately 30 and approximately 5%, respectively, of the 
      RG-II. In contrast, the dimer accounts for approximately 80 and approximately 54%
      of the RG-II when the monomer is treated for 24 h at pH 3.4 and 5.0,
      respectively, with boric acid and 0.5 m Sr2+, Pb2+, or Ba2+. The amount of dimer 
      formed at pH 3.4 or 5.0 is not increased by addition of 0.5 mM Ca2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, 
      Mg2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. Steric considerations appear to regulate dimer formation
      since those divalent cations that enhance dimer formation have an ionic radius
      >1.1 A. Our data suggest that the borate ester is located on C-2 and C-3 of two
      of the four 3'-linked apiosyl residues of dimeric RG-II. Our results, taken
      together with the results of two previous studies (Kobayashi, M., Matoh, T., and 
      Azuma, J.-I. (1996) Plant Physiol. 110, 1017-1020; Ishii, T., and Matsunaga, T.
      (1996) Carbohydr. Res. 284, 1-9) provide substantial evidence that this plant
      cell wall pectic polysaccharide is covalently cross-linked.

TI  - Induction of beta-methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A carboxylase in higher plant cells
      during carbohydrate starvation: evidence for a role of MCCase in leucine
      catabolism.
PG  - 175-80
AB  - Induction of beta-methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (MCCase) activity was
      observed during carbohydrate starvation in sycamore cells. In mitochondria
      isolated from starved cells, we noticed a marked accumulation of the biotinylated
      subunit of MCCase, of which the apparent molecular weight of 74000 was similar to
      that of the polypeptide from mitochondria of potato tubers. Our results provide
      evidence for a role of MCCase in the catabolic pathway of leucine, a
      branched-chain amino acid which transiently accumulates in carbon-starved cells
      in relation to a massive breakdown of proteins. Furthermore, when control
      sycamore cells were incubated in the presence of exogenous leucine, this amino
      acid accumulated in the cells and no induction or accumulation of MCCase was
      observed, indicating that leucine is not responsible for the induction of its
      catabolic machinery. Finally, MCCase is proposed as a new biochemical marker of
      the autophagic process triggered by carbohydrate starvation.

TI  - An antibody Fab selected from a recombinant phage display library detects
      deesterified pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan II in plant cells.
PG  - 673-85
AB  - Rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) is a structurally complex, low molecular weight
      pectic polysaccharide that is released from primary cell walls of higher plants
      by treatment with endopolygalacturonase and is chromatographically purified after
      alkaline deesterification. A recombinant monovalent antibody fragment (Fab) that 
      specifically recognizes RG-II has been obtained by selection from a phage display
      library of mouse immunoglobulin genes. By itself, RG-II is not immunogenic.
      Therefore, mice were immunized with a neoglycoprotein prepared by covalent
      attachment of RG-II to modified BSA. A cDNA library of the mouse IgG1/kappa
      antibody repertoire was constructed in the phage display vector pComb3. Selection
      of antigen-binding phage particles resulted in the isolation of an antibody Fab, 
      CCRC-R1, that binds alkali-treated RG-II with high specificity. CCRC-R1 binds an 
      epitope found primarily at sites proximal to the plasma membrane of
      suspension-cultured sycamore maple cells. In cells deesterified by alkali,
      CCRC-R1 labels the entire wall, suggesting that the RG-II epitope recognized by
      CCRC-R1 is masked by esterification in most of the wall and tha such RG-II
      esterification is absent near the plasma membrane.

TI  - A community classification system for forest evaluation: Development, validation,
      and extrapolation.
PG  - 299-321
LID - 10.1007/BF00396151 [doi]
AB  - A community classification system integrating vegetation and landforms was
      developed for the 8,054-ha Cheatham Wildlife Management Area (CWMA), located on
      the Western Highland Rim of Tennessee, USA, to obtain information on which to
      base multiresource land management decisions. A subjective procedure (synthesis
      tables) and several objective techniques (factor analysis, cluster analysis, and 
      canonical discrimination) were used to evaluate importance values of overstory
      and midstory species, coverage values of understory species, and topographic
      parameters. These procedures were used collectively to guide and to provide
      evidence for interpretation of vegetational patterns on the landscape. The eight 
      discrete communities identified on a 482-ha compartment within the CWMA were:
      northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), chestnut oak (Q. prinus L.), scarlet oak (Q.
      coccinea Muenchh.), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.), sycamore-sweetgum
      (Platanus occidentalis L.-Liquidambar styraciflua L.), black oak-hickory (Q.
      velutina Lam.-Carya spp.), post oak (Q. stellata Wangenh.), and American beech
      (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) communities. The classification system was validated
      with an independent data set. The eight communities were successfully
      extrapolated to an unsampled portion of the CWMA. Clearly, community analysis can
      become an important facet in forest management and may play a major role where a 
      holistic understanding of vegetative relationships is essential.

TI  - Analysis of tree rings using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to
      record fluctuations in a metal pollution episode.
PG  - 93-102
AB  - Analysis of Acer pseudoplatanus L. (sycamore) tree rings using ICP-MS was used to
      assess the impact of metal deposition on trees growing in the vicinity of a metal
      refinery at Prescot, north-west England compared to a reference site at Croxteth 
      6 km distant receiving minimal deposition. No difference in tree growth between
      sites was recorded. Large reductions in Cu and Cd deposition since the late 1970s
      was accompanied by a steep decline in Cd concentrations in the outer rings in
      trees close to the refinery. A similar reduction in Cu concentrations was less
      apparent due to a tendency for Cu to increase in the outer rings. Zinc and Ni
      were higher in xylem at Prescot compared to Croxteth. There was no trend in Zn
      concentrations at either site although Ni concentrations increased in trees close
      to the refinery after 1982. Manganese concentrations in xylem were much higher at
      Prescot; Mn levels declined until the late 1970s and then increased slightly in
      later years interspersed by large concentration peaks within individual years
      during the 1980s. There was little change in Mn concentrations in trees at
      Croxteth during this period. Calcium, Mg and Sr concentrations remained steady or
      declined slightly in rings formed since 1965 in trees at Croxteth. Concentrations
      of Ca, Mg and Sr were higher in rings formed prior to the mid 1970s in trees at
      Prescot, but declined steadily after this period, although peaks in
      concentrations of each element were recorded in individual years during the
      1980s. Phosphorous concentrations in rings increased towards the cambium at
      Croxteth, although P levels decreased in rings formed after 1982 at Prescot. No
      difference in K concentrations between sites was recorded. Lead concentrations in
      xylem at both sites declined steadily in rings formed after 1970, although
      concentrations were higher at the reference site. Analysis of individual sycamore
      tree rings appears to record short-term changes in pollution episodes, with
      little lateral movement of elements occurring. It is suggested that changes in
      element concentrations in trees close to the refinery are a result of reduced
      metal deposition combined with increased soil acidity due to reduced buffering
      capacity of metal ions in rainfall.

TI  - The backbone of the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I is cleaved by an
      endohydrolase and an endolyase.
PG  - 783-9
AB  - Rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), a major pectic component of the primary walls of
      plant cells, is believed to play an important role in determining both the
      structure and functions of the walls. A more detailed structural description of
      RG-I is likely to lead to a greater understanding of the biological roles of this
      polysaccharide. Two enzymes secreted by Aspergillus aculeatus that have been
      cloned and expressed in a fungal system (Kofod et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269,
      29182-29189, 1994) cleave the RG-I backbone in an endo fashion and should assist 
      in the further structural characterization of this polysaccharide. We found that 
      both of the available preparations of the cloned enzymes were contaminated with
      exoglycanases, reducing their utility in structurally characterizing RG-I. We
      purified the enzymes to apparent homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography and
      then used the purified enzymes to generate backbone oligosaccharide fragments
      from partially debranched sycamore RG-I. The backbone oligosaccharides, which
      were separated from larger pieces of partially debranched RG-I by gel-permeation 
      chromatography, have been structurally characterized by 1H-NMR spectroscopy,
      electrospray MS, GC-MS, high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with
      pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) and UV spectroscopy. The results of
      these analyses establish that rhamnogalacturonase A (RGase A) is an endohydrolase
      that cleaves the -4)-alpha-D-GalpA-(1-2)-alpha-L-Rhap glycosidic linkage.
      However, the purported rhamnogalacturonase B (RGase B) is, in fact, an endolyase 
      that cleaves the -2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-4)-alpha-D-GalpA glycosidic linkage, thereby
      generating oligosaccharides terminating at the non-reducing end with a
      hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid residue.

      (RG-II) by selective acid hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkages of apiosyl

      alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl residue of the aceric acid-containing heptasaccharide 2
      that had been previously isolated from RG-II [M.W. Spellman et al. Carbohydr.
      Res., 122 (1983) 131-153]. Heptasaccharide 2 and octasaccharide 1 were found to
      be mono- or di-O-acetylated. The O-acetyl groups were located, by ESMSMS, on the 
      terminal nonreducing 2-O-methyl-alpha-L-fucosyl residue and/or on the 2-linked
      beta-L-aceryl acid residue. Octasaccharide 1 and heptasaccharide 2 have the

TI  - The statolith compartment in Chara rhizoids contains carbohydrate and protein.
PG  - 220-9
AB  - In contrast to higher plants, the alga Chara has rhizoids with single
      membrane-bound compartments that function as statoliths in gravity perception.
      Previous work has demonstrated that these statoliths contain barium sulfate
      crystals. In this study, we show that statoliths in Chara rhizoids react with a
      Coomassie Brilliant Blue cytochemical stain for proteins. While statoliths did
      not react with silver methenamine carbohydrate cytochemistry, the monoclonal
      antibody CCRC-M2, which is against a carbohydrate (sycamore-maple
      rhamnogalacturonan I), labeled the statolith compartment. These results
      demonstrate that in addition to barium sulfate, statoliths in Chara rhizoids have
      an organic matrix that consists of protein and carbohydrate moieties. Since the
      statoliths were silver methenamine negative, the carbohydrate in this compartment
      could be a 3-linked polysaccharide. CCRC-M2 also labeled Golgi cisternae,
      Golgi-associated vesicles, apical vesicles, and cell walls in the rhizoids. The
      specificity of CCRC-M2 immunolabeling was verified by several control
      experiments, including the demonstration that labeling was abolished when the
      antibody was preabsorbed with its antigen. Since in this and a previous study
      (John Z. Kiss and L. Andrew Staehelin, American Journal of Botany 80: 273-282,
      1993) antibodies against higher plant carbohydrates crossreacted with cell walls 
      of Chara in a specific manner, Characean algae may be a useful model system in
      biochemical and molecular studies of cell walls.

      suspension-cultured sycamore cells. The backbone-cleaving enzyme, which is
      present in the beta-D-galactosidase preparation, only fragments the RG-I backbone
      when many of the neutral oligoglycosyl side chains have been removed by the other
      exo- and endo- glycanases. The oligosaccharides released from the backbone were
      separated from the partially fragmented RG-I and then purified, as their
      oligoglycosyl aldonic acids, by HPAEC-PAD. Those backbone fragments with degrees 
      of polymerization (dp's) between 2 and 11 were characterized using one- and
      two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy, electrospray mass spectrometry, and
      glycosyl-residue and glycosyl-linkage composition analyses. Two series of
      oligoglycosyl fragments were identified. The quantitatively predominant series
      has the structure alpha-D-GalpA-(1 --> 2)- alpha-L-Rhap-[ --> 4)-alpha-D-GalpA-(1
      --> 2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 --> ]n-4-D-GalpA, and the quantitatively minor series has 
      the structure alpha-L-Rhap-[ --> 4)-alpha-D-GalpA-(1 --> 2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 -->
      ]n-4-D- GalpA (n = 1-5). Thus, the enzyme preparations contain an
      alpha-L-rhamnosidase in addition to the endo- rhamnogalacturonase. The products
      of the endo-rhamnogalacturonase provide additional evidence that the backbone of 
      RG-I is composed of the diglycosyl repeating unit: --> 4)-alpha-D-GalpA-(1 -->
      2)-alpha-L-Rhap- (1 -->. The endo-rhamnogalacturonase from the A. niger
      beta-D-galactosidase preparation and the endo- rhamnogalacturonase secreted by
      Aspergillus aculeatus [H.A. Schols et al. Carbohydr. Res., 206 (1990) 117-129]
      have the same substrate specificities and generate similar oligoglycosyl
      fragments.

TI  - Inhibition of fatty acid desaturation in sycamore cells deprived of iron.
PG  - 95-8
AB  - The growth of isolated sycamore cells in a medium devoid of iron induced a marked
      reduction of the unsaturation level of fatty acids: the proportion of linolenic
      acid (C18:3) in polar lipids (phospholipids and galactolipids) decreased whereas 
      a parallel increase in the proportions of oleic (C18:1) and linoleic (C18:2) acid
      was observed. In our experimental conditions, no direct effect of iron
      deprivation on fatty acid and glycerolipid biosynthesis could be observed. When
      sycamore cells were incubated in the presence of [14C]acetate, the level of
      unsaturation in fatty acids was very strongly reduced: no polyunsaturated fatty
      acids were synthesized in iron-deprived cells: only [14C]palmitic and [14C]oleic 
      acids accumulated in glycerolipids. In contrast, sycamore cells grown in an
      iron-containing medium in the presence of [14C]acetate were able to synthesize
      glycerolipids containing 14C-labelled C18:2 and C18:3. We concluded that, in
      sycamore cells, iron is essential for C18:1-->C18:2-->C18:3 desaturations. In
      contrast, C18:0-->C18:1 desaturation is much less sensitive to iron deprivation
      under our experimental conditions.

TI  - Multiple effects of glycerol on plant cell metabolism. Phosphorus-31 nuclear
      magnetic resonance studies.
PG  - 21420-7
AB  - The effects of glycerol on plant cell metabolism were studied with sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.) cells using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After
      a long period of sucrose starvation, the addition of 50 mM glycerol to the medium
      did not restore the original glucose-6-P pool and led to a rapid accumulation of 
      sn-glycerol-3-P in the cytoplasmic compartment. The synthesis of sn-glycerol-3-P 
      was rapid and occurred first at the expense of cytoplasmic P(i). Accumulated
      sn-glycerol-3-P competitively inhibited glucose-6-phosphate isomerase activity
      when fructose-6-P was the varied substrate. Such a situation prevented the rapid 
      recycling of triose phosphates back to hexose phosphates and led to an arrest of 
      the functioning of the cytosolic and plastidial pentose phosphate pathways. Under
      these conditions, the flow of carbon to drive cell respiration derived almost
      exclusively from glycerol, and this polyalcohol was not used as a source of
      carbon skeletons for biosynthesis. Glycerol also induced the accumulation of
      O-phosphohomoserine in the cytoplasmic compartment as long as the cell culture
      medium contained sucrose. Finally glycerol added to sucrose-starved cells stopped
      the accumulation of phosphocholine (Roby, C., Martin J.-B., Bligny, R., and
      Douce, R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5000-5007) and prevented a further decline
      in the uncoupled rate of O2 consumption by the cells (Journet, E. P., Bligny, R.,
      and Douce, R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3193-3199). These last observations
      strongly suggest that glycerol prevented the triggering of autophagy induced by
      sucrose starvation in sycamore cells.

      Characterization of a monoclonal antibody to a terminal alpha-(1-->2)-linked
      fucosyl-containing epitope.
PG  - 699-710
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) generated against rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I)
      purified from suspension-cultured sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells fall
      into three recognition groups. Four McAbs (group I) recognize an epitope that
      appears to be immunodominant and is present on RG-I from maize and sycamore
      maple, pectin and polygalacturonic acid from citrus, gum tragacanth, and membrane
      glycoproteins from suspension-cultured cells of maize, tobacco, parsley, bean,
      and sycamore maple. A second set of McAbs (group II) recognizes an epitope
      present in sycamore maple RG-I but does not bind to any of the other
      polysaccharides or glycoproteins recognized by group I. Lastly, one McAb, CCRC-M1
      (group III), binds to RG-I and more strongly to xyloglucan (XG) from sycamore
      maple but not to maize RG-I, citrus polygalacturonic acid, or to the plant
      membrane glycoproteins recognized by group I. The epitope to which CCRC-M1 binds 
      has been examined in detail. Ligand competition assays using a series of
      oligosaccharides derived from or related to sycamore maple XG demonstrated that a
      terminal alpha-(1-->2)-linked fucosyl residue constitutes an essential part of
      the epitope recognized by CCRC-M1. Oligosaccharides containing this structural
      motif compete with intact sycamore maple XG for binding to the antibody, whereas 
      structurally related oligosaccharides, which do not contain terminal fucosyl
      residues or in which the terminal fucosyl residue is linked alpha-(1-->3) to the 
      adjacent glycosyl residue, do not compete for the antibody binding site. The
      ligand binding assays also indicate that CCRC-M1 binds to a conformationally
      dependent structure of the polysaccharide. Other results of this study establish 
      that some of the carbohydrate epitopes of the plant extracellular matrix are
      shared among different macromolecules.

      cell-wall pectic polysaccharide, rhamnogalacturonan I.
PG  - 235-43
AB  - Rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), a pectic polysaccharide isolated from the walls of
      suspension-cultured sycamore cells, was shown by glycosyl-residue composition
      analysis to contain D-glucosyluronic acid (GlcpA) residues (1 mol%) and
      4-O-methyl-D-glucosyluronic acid (4-O-Me-GlcpA) residues (0.5 mol%). These
      monosaccharides were shown, by glycosyl-linkage analysis, to be present in RG-I
      as terminal nonreducing residues. The glycosyl sequences containing GlcpA and
      4-O-Me-GlcpA were determined by structurally characterizing the acidic
      oligosaccharides released by partial acid hydrolysis of RG-I. Six acidic
      oligosaccharides were purified by semipreparative high-performance anion-exchange
      chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) and characterized
      by glycosyl-residue and glycosyl-linkage composition analyses, GLC-CIMS,
      GLC-EIMS, electrospray MS (ESMS), and 1H NMR spectroscopy. We propose that three 
      of the acidic oligosaccharides characterized, 4-O-Me-beta-D-GlcpA-(1-->6)-D-Gal, 
      beta-D-GlcpA-(1-->6)-D-Gal, and beta-D-GlcpA-(1-->4)-D-Gal, originate from the
      galactosyl-containing side chains of RG-I. The three other acidic
      oligosaccharides characterized, alpha-D-GalpA-(1-->2)-L-Rha,
      alpha-D-GalpA-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->4)-alpha-D-GalpA+ ++-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rha,

      Rhap-(1-->4)-alpha-D-GalpA-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rha, were generated by partial
      hydrolysis of the RG-I backbone. No evidence was obtained for the presence of
      galactosyluronic acid in the side chains of RG-I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Effect of Iron Deficiency on the Respiration of Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.)
      Cells.
PG  - 1329-1338
AB  - The effects of iron deficiency on cell culture growth, cell respiration,
      mitochondrial oxidative properties, and the electron transport chain were studied
      with suspension-cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells. Iron
      deprivation considerably decreased the initial growth rates and limited the
      maximum density of the cells. Under these conditions, the cells remained swollen 
      throughout their growth. The absence of iron led to a steady decline in the
      uncoupled rate of O2 consumption. When the uncoupled rate of O2 uptake closely
      approximated the respiratory rate, the cells began to collapse. At this stage,
      the level of all the cytochromes and electron paramagnetic resonance-detectable
      Fe-S clusters of the mitochondrial inner membrane were dramatically decreased.
      Nevertheless, it appeared from substrate oxidation measurements that this overall
      depletion in iron-containing components solely disturbed the functioning of
      complex II, whereas neither complexes I, III, or IV, nor the machinery involved
      in ATP synthesis, was apparently impaired in iron-deficient mitochondria.
      However, our results suggest that the impairment of complex II resulted in a
      strong reduction of the overall capacity of the mitochondrial electron transport 
      chain, which was responsible for determining the rate of endogenous respiration
      in sycamore cells. Finally, this situation led to a depletion of various energy
      metabolites that could contribute to the premature cell death.

      (Acer pseudoplatanus L.): application for structural analysis of
      xylose-containing N-linked oligosaccharides.
PG  - 205-9
AB  - A beta-xylosidase was purified 51-fold from culture medium of sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.) cells using p-nitrophenyl beta-D-xylopyranoside as a
      substrate. This enzyme can remove a xylose residue from asparagine-linked
      oligosaccharides, derivatized with 2-aminopyridine. A pentasaccharide, Xy1 beta
      2Man beta 4GlcNAc beta 4(Fuc-alpha 3)GlcNAc was the favorite substrate in
      N-linked oligosaccharides, but a xylose residue in Xy1 beta 2(Man-alpha 3)Man
      beta sequence could not be removed by the enzyme. We also propose an efficient
      method for detection of xylose residue in N-linked oligosaccharides by a
      combination of the two-dimensional sugar mapping technique and the xylosidase
      digestion.

TI  - Structural characterization of endo-glycanase-generated oligoglycosyl side chains
      of rhamnogalacturonan I.
PG  - 359-71
AB  - Rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) has been isolated from the walls of
      suspension-cultured sycamore cells (Acer pseudoplatanus), and additional
      structural features of the polysaccharide were elucidated. Treatment of RG-I with
      a purified endo-(1-->5)-alpha-L-arabinanase released a series of
      arabinose-containing oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization (dp's)
      between 2 and 20. These oligosaccharides were shown, by glycosyl-linkage
      composition analysis, to contain terminal, 5-, and (3-->5)-linked Araf residues. 
      These results provide evidence that a branched arabinan is attached to the
      backbone of RG-I. RG-I was freed of 95% of its arabinosyl residues by treating
      the polysaccharide with a combination of endo-(1-->5)-alpha-L-arabinanase and
      alpha-L-arabinosidase. No galacturonic acid was released by these enzymes, which 
      is evidence that the arabinosyl-containing portions of the side chains do not
      contain galactosyluronic acid residues. The galactose-containing portions of the 
      side chains of RG-I were not fragmented by an endo-(1-->4)-beta-D-galactanase.
      However, approximately 85% of the galactose and small amounts of galacturonic
      acid were released by digestion of arabinose-depleted RG-I with a combination of 
      endo- and exo-beta-D-galactanases. The galacturonic acid may have been released
      by small amounts of an exo-alpha-galactosyluronidase contaminating the
      galactanases. Treatment of RG-I with this mixture of endo- and exo-glycanases
      resulted in a relatively size-homogeneous, almost side chain-free backbone
      composed of the O-acetylated diglycosyl repeating unit
      -->4)-alpha-D-GalpA-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap. A combination of 1H NMR spectroscopy
      and periodate oxidation established that the backbone repeating unit contained a 
      single O-acetyl substituent on C-2 or C-3 of each galactosyluronic acid residue.

TI  - Effect of brefeldin A on the structure of the Golgi apparatus and on the
      synthesis and secretion of proteins and polysaccharides in sycamore maple (Acer
      pseudoplatanus) suspension-cultured cells.
PG  - 1363-73
AB  - Brefeldin A (BFA), a specific inhibitor of Golgi-mediated secretion in animal
      cells, has been used to study the organization of the secretory pathway and the
      function of the Golgi apparatus in plant cells. To this end, we have employed a
      combination of electron microscopical, immunocytochemical, and biochemical
      techniques to investigate the effects of this drug on the architecture of the
      Golgi apparatus as well as on the secretion of proteins and complex cell wall
      polysaccharides in sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) suspension-cultured
      cells. We have used 2.5 and 7.5 micrograms/mL of BFA, which is comparable to the 
      1 to 10 micrograms/mL used in experiments with animal cells. Electron micrographs
      of high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted cells show that although BFA
      causes swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum cisternae, unlike in animal cells,
      it does not induce the disassembly of sycamore maple Golgi stacks. Instead, BFA
      induces the formation of large clusters of Golgi stacks, an increase in the
      number of trans-like Golgi cisternae, and the accumulation in the cytoplasm of
      very dense vesicles that appear to be derived from trans Golgi cisternae. These
      vesicles contain large amounts of xyloglucan (XG), the major hemicellulosic cell 
      wall polysaccharide, as shown by immunocytochemical labeling with anti-XG
      antibodies. All of these structural changes disappear within 120 min after
      removal of the drug. In vivo labeling experiments using [3H]leucine demonstrate
      that protein secretion into the culture medium, but not protein synthesis, is
      inhibited by approximately 80% in the presence of BFA. In contrast, the
      incorporation of [3H]fucose into N-linked glycoproteins, which occurs in
      trans-Golgi cisternae, appears to be affected to a greater extent than the
      incorporation of [3H]xylose, which has been localized to medial Golgi cisternae. 
      BFA also affects secretion of complex polysaccharides as evidenced by the
      approximate 50% drop in incorporation of [3H]xylose and [3H]fucose into cell wall
      hemicelluloses. Taken together, these findings suggest that at concentrations of 
      2.5 to 7.5 mu g/mL BFA causes the following major changes in the secretory
      pathway of sycamore maple cells: (a) it inhibits the transport of secretory
      proteins to the cell surface by about 80% and of hemicelluloses by about 50%; (b)
      it changes the patterns of glycosylation of N-linked glycoproteins and
      hemicelluloses; (c) it reduces traffic between trans Golgi cisternae and
      secretory vesicles; (d) it produces a major block in the transport of
      XG-containing, dense secretory vesicles to the cell surface; and (e) it induces
      the formation of large aggregates of Golgi apparatus of plant and animal cels
      share many functional and structural characteristics, the plant Golgi apparatus
      possesses properties that make its response to BFA unique.

PG  - 89-92
LID - 10.1007/BF00649511 [doi]
AB  - The hypothesis that seasonal changes in sycamore aphid,Drepanosiphum platanoidis 
      (Schr.), recruitment are determined by changes in food quality and aphid
      population density was tested. There was no clear association between the
      reproductive activity of the sycamore aphid and the seasonal changes in specific 
      amino acids or groups of amino acids in extracts of sycamore,Acer pseudoplatanus 
      L., leaves. Seasonal changes in reproductive activity tracked the changes in
      total amino acids of the leaf tissue of the host, but with a short time delay.
      High numbers of adult aphids appeared to depress reproductive activity. A
      regression analysis of the results revealed that total amino acids the previous
      week and current numbers of adult aphids significantly affected sycamore aphid
      reproductive activity. The results of this analysis support the above hypothesis,
      that the marked seasonal changes in the total quantity of amino acids in sycamore
      leaves and intraspecific competition for this resource, through its effect on
      adult weight, shape the seasonal cycle in the reproductive activity of the
      sycamore aphid.

TI  - Occurrence of heterogeneity of N-linked oligosaccharides attached to sycamore
      (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) laccase after excretion.
PG  - 395-402
AB  - The N-linked oligosaccharide moieties of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.)
      laccase are known to be highly heterogeneous. We confirmed that this
      oligosaccharide heterogeneity was caused not only during the oligosaccharide
      biosynthesis in Golgi apparatus, but also after the excretion of laccase protein 
      into a culture medium. The culture medium for the sycamore cells (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.) contained beta-galactosidase, alpha-L-fucosidase,
      beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, alpha-mannosidase and beta-xylosidase activities.
      We showed that the largest sugar chain in laccase, oligosaccharide F, [formula:
      see text] was degraded to [formula: see text] by a crude exoglycosidase mixture
      in the culture medium.

TI  - Effect of monensin on plant Golgi: re-examination of the monensin-induced changes
      in cisternal architecture and functional activities of the Golgi apparatus of
      sycamore suspension-cultured cells.
PG  - 819-31
AB  - We have re-examined the effects of the ionophore monensin on the Golgi apparatus 
      of sycamore maple suspension-cultured cells using a combination of high pressure 
      freezing, immunocytochemical and biochemical techniques. Exposure of the cells to
      10 microM monensin, which reduces protein secretion by approximately 90%,
      resulted first in the swelling of the trans-Golgi network, then of the trans-most
      trans-cisterna, the remaining trans-cisternae, and finally of the cis and medial 
      cisternae. We postulate that these different rates of swelling reflect an
      underlying hierarchy of compartmental acidification with the trans-Golgi network 
      being the most acidic compartment. Recovery occurred in the reverse sequence.
      Previous studies have suggested that the large swollen vesicles that accumulate
      in the cytoplasm of monensin-treated cells arise from the swelling and detachment
      of entire trans-cisternae. However, based on the many membrane blebbing
      configurations seen in association with the trans-Golgi network and the
      trans-Golgi cisternae of monensin-treated cells, and the fact that the surface
      area of the trans-Golgi cisternae is about five times greater than the surface
      area of the swollen vesicles, it appears that the swollen vesicles are produced
      by a budding mechanism. After 35-40 min of monensin treatment, cells with
      smaller, non-swollen, compact Golgi stacks began to appear and rapidly increased 
      in number, contributing > 60% of the cell population after 60 min and > 80% after
      100 min. In contrast, large numbers of swollen vesicles persisted in the
      cytoplasm of all cells for over 100 min. Since azide treatment of
      monensin-treated cells can prematurely induce the unswelling response and
      cellular ATP levels drop substantially after 45 min of monensin treatment, we
      propose that un-swelling of the Golgi stacks is due to a monensin-induced decline
      in ATP levels in the cells. Immunocytochemical labeling of the high pressure
      frozen cells with anti-xyloglucan antibodies demonstrated that the concentration 
      of xyloglucan, a hemicellulose, in the swollen vesicles increased with time. This
      increase in vesicle contents may explain why these swollen vesicles do not
      contract in parallel with the Golgi stacks. In vivo labeling experiments with
      [3H]fucose, [3H]UDP-glucose and [3H]leucine demonstrated that monensin-treatment 
      not only inhibited protein secretion, but also cellulose synthesis. Protein
      synthesis, on the other hand, was reduced only slightly during the first 30 min
      of treatment, but quite strongly between 30 and 60 min, consistent with the
      observed drop in ATP levels after > 40 min of exposure to monensin.(ABSTRACT

AB  - The synthesis of malate and citrate by sycamore cells (Acer pseudoplatanus L.)
      perfused with KH13CO3 was analyzed using 13C NMR. To perform in vivo experiments,
      cells were compressed in a 25-mm tube and perfused with an arrangement enabling
      tight control of the circulating nutrient medium. An original method using
      paramagnetic Mn2+ that induced a complete loss of the vacuolar malate and citrate
      signals was developed to discriminate between cytoplasmic and vacuolar pools of
      malate and citrate. Our results indicated the following. (a) The accumulation of 
      appreciable amounts of malate in sycamore cells required rather high (1 mM)
      concentrations of bicarbonate at all the pH values tested. (b) Malate was equally
      labeled at C-1 and C-4, suggesting that malate labeled at C-1 was produced by
      randomization of C-1 and C-4 by mitochondrial fumarase. Indeed, the separation of
      the intact organelles from the lysed protoplasts indicated that fumarase activity
      was essentially limited to the mitochondria. Similarly, citrate was equally
      enriched at C-1 and C-5 + C-6 carboxyls. (c) Malate appeared first in the
      cytoplasmic compartment; and when a threshold of cytoplasmic malate concentration
      was attained, malate molecules were expelled into the vacuole, where they
      accumulated. On the other hand, citrate accumulated steadily in the vacuole.
      Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated the central role played by the tonoplast in 
      governing the vacuolar influx of citrate and the permanent exchange of malate
      between the cytoplasm and the vacuole.

TI  - Artifactual detection of ADP-dependent sucrose synthase in crude plant extracts.
PG  - 283-7
AB  - Results presented in a previous report from this laboratory indicated the
      presence, in crude extracts from sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and spinach
      (Spinacea oleracea), of a sucrose synthase (EC 2.4.1.13) showing high affinity
      for ADP as the glucose acceptor in the sucrose-cleaving reaction. In the present 
      paper we report that the modified enzymatic method previously used to measure
      sucrose synthase activities leads to the detection of artifactual ADP-dependent
      sucrose synthase, which in fact arises from the combined action of invertase (EC 
      3.2.1.26) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) activities. We also
      present data on the partial purification of nucleoside diphosphate kinase from
      sycamore cells.

TI  - Effect of glyphosate on plant cell metabolism. 31P and 13C NMR studies.
PG  - 875-82
AB  - The effect of glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl glycine; the active ingredient of
      Roundup herbicide) on plant cells metabolism was analysed by 31P and 13C NMR
      using suspension-cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L) cells. Cells were
      compressed in the NMR tube and perfused with an original arrangement enabling a
      tight control of the circulating nutrient medium. Addition of 1 mM glyphosate to 
      the nutrient medium triggered the accumulation of shikimate (20-30 mumol g-1 cell
      wet weight within 50 h) and shikimate 3-phosphate (1-1.5 mumol g-1 cell wet
      weight within 50 h). From in vivo spectra it was demonstrated that these two
      compounds were accumulated in the cytoplasm where their concentrations reached
      potentially lethal levels. On the other hand, glyphosate present in the
      cytoplasmic compartment was extensively metabolized to yield
      aminomethylphosphonic acid which also accumulated in the cytoplasm. Finally, the 
      results presented in this paper indicate that although the cell growth was
      stopped by glyphosate the cell respiration rates and the level of energy
      metabolism intermediates remained unchanged.

PG  - 13903-9
AB  - The regulation of the cytoplasmic and vacuolar pH values (pHc and pHv) in
      sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells was analyzed using 31P and 13C nuclear
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Suspension-cultured cells were compressed in the
      NMR tube and perfused with the help of an original arrangement enabling a tight
      control of the pH (external pH, pHe) of the carefully oxygenated circulating
      nutrient medium. Intracellular pH values were measured from the chemical shifts
      of: CH2-linked carboxyl groups of citric acid below pH 5.7; orthophosphate
      between pH 5.7 and 8.0; 13C-enriched bicarbonate over pH 8.0. pHc and pHv were
      independent of pHe over the range 4.5-7.5. In contrast intracellular pH values
      decreased rapidly below pHe 4.5 and increased progressively at pHe over 7.5.
      There was an acceleration in the rate of O2 consumption accompanied with a
      decrease in cytoplasmic ATP concentration as pHe decreased. When the rate of O2
      consumption was approaching the uncoupled O2 uptake rate, a loss of pHc control
      was observed. It is concluded that as pHe decreased, the plasma membrane ATPase
      consumed more and more ATP to reject the invading H+ ions in order to maintain
      pHc at a constant value. Below pHe 4.5 the efficiency of the H+ pump to react to 
      back leakage of H+ ions became insufficient, leading to an acidification of pHc
      and to an alkalinization of pHe. On the other hand, over pHe 7.5 a passive influx
      of OH- ions was observed, and pHc increased proportionally to the increase of
      pHe. Simultaneously appreciable amounts of organic acids (malate and citrate)
      were synthesized by cells during the course of the alkalinization of the
      cytoplasmic compartment. The synthesis of organic acids which partially
      counteract the alkalinization of the cytoplasmic compartment may result from a
      marked activation of the cytoplasmic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase induced by
      an increase in cytoplasmic bicarbonate concentration. The fluctuations of pHv
      followed a similar course to that of pHc. It is concluded that the vacuole, which
      represents a potentially large H+ ions reservoir, can counteract H+ (or OH-) ion 
      invasion observed at acidic (or alkaline) pHe contributing to the homeostasis of 
      pHc.

TI  - Laccase from Sycamore Maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) Polymerizes Monolignols.
PG  - 1162-8
AB  - Current understanding of the final oxidative steps leading to lignin deposition
      in trees and other higher plants is limited with respect to what enzymes are
      involved, where they are localized, how they are transported, and what factors
      regulate them. With the use of cell suspension cultures of sycamore maple (Acer
      pseudoplatanus), an in-depth study of laccase, one of the oxidative enzymes
      possibly responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenative polymerization of
      monolignols in the extracellular matrix, was undertaken. The time course for
      secretion of laccase into suspension culture medium was determined with respect
      to age and mass of the cells. Laccase was completely separated from peroxidase
      activity by hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, and its purity was
      assessed with different types of gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing-,
      native-, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Amino
      acid and glycosyl analyses of the purified enzyme were compared with those
      reported from previous studies of plant and fungal laccases. The specific
      activity of laccase toward several common substrates, including monolignols, was 
      determined. Unlike a laccase purified from the Japanese lacquer tree (Rhus
      vernicifera), laccase from sycamore maple oxidized sinapyl, coniferyl, and
      p-coumaryl alcohols to form water-insoluble polymers (dehydrogenation polymers).

TI  - Functional compartmentation of the Golgi apparatus of plant cells :
      immunocytochemical analysis of high-pressure frozen- and freeze-substituted
      sycamore maple suspension culture cells.
PG  - 1070-83
AB  - The Golgi apparatus of plant cells is engaged in both the processing of
      glycoproteins and the synthesis of complex polysaccharides. To investigate the
      compartmentalization of these functions within individual Golgi stacks, we have
      analyzed the ultrastructure and the immunolabeling patterns of high-pressure
      frozen and freeze-substituted suspension-cultured sycamore maple (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.) cells. As a result of the improved structural preservation,
      three morphological types of Golgi cisternae, designated cis, medial, and trans, 
      as well as the trans Golgi network, could be identified. The number of cis
      cisternae per Golgi stack was found to be fairly constant at approximately 1,
      whereas the number of medial and trans cisternae per stack was variable and
      accounted for the varying number of cisternae (3-10) among the many Golgi stacks 
      examined. By using a battery of seven antibodies whose specific sugar epitopes on
      secreted polysaccharides and glycoproteins are known, we have been able to
      determine in which types of cisternae specific sugars are added to N-linked
      glycans, and to xyloglucan and polygalacturonic acid/rhamnogalacturonan-I, two
      complex polysaccharides. The findings are as follows. The beta-1,4-linked
      d-glucosyl backbone of xyloglucan is synthesized in trans cisternae, and the
      terminal fucosyl residues on the trisaccharide side chains of xyloglucan are
      partly added in the trans cisternae, and partly in the trans Golgi network. In
      contrast, the polygalacturonic/rhamnogalacturonan-I backbone is assembled in cis 
      and medial cisternae, methylesterification of the carboxyl groups of the
      galacturonic acid residues in the polygalacturonic acid domains occurs mostly in 
      medial cisternae, and arabinose-containing side chains of the polygalacturonic
      acid domains are added to the nascent polygalacturonic acid/rhamnogalacturonan-I 
      molecules in the trans cisternae. Double labeling experiments demonstrate that
      xyloglucan and polygalacturonic acid/rhamnogalacturonan-I can be synthesized
      concomitantly within the same Golgi stack. Finally, we show that the xylosyl
      residue-linked beta-1,2 to the beta-linked mannose of the core of N-linked
      glycans is added in medial cisternae. Taken together, our results indicate that
      in sycamore maple suspension-cultured cells, different types of Golgi cisternae
      contain different sets of glycosyl transferases, that the functional organization
      of the biosynthetic pathways of complex polysaccharides is consistent with these 
      molecules being processed in a cis to trans direction like the N-linked glycans, 
      and that the complex polysaccharide xyloglucan is assembled exclusively in trans 
      Golgi cisternae and the trans Golgi network.

PG  - 180-5
AB  - The structural features required for xyloglucan oligosaccharides to inhibit
      2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-stimulated elongation of pea stem segments have
      been investigated. A nonasaccharide (XG9) containing one fucosyl-galactosyl side 
      chain and an undecasaccharide (XG11) containing two fucosyl-galactosyl side
      chains were purified from endo-beta-1,4-glucanase-treated xyloglucan, which had
      been isolated from soluble extracellular polysaccharides of suspension-cultured
      sycamore (Acerpseudoplatanus) cells and tested in the pea stem bioassay. A novel 
      octasaccharide (XG8') was prepared by treatment of XG9 with a xyloglucan
      oligosaccharide-specific alpha-xylosidase from pea seedlings. XG8' was
      characterized and tested for its ability to inhibit auxin-induced growth. All
      three oligosaccharides, at a concentration of 0.1 microgram per milliliter,
      inhibited 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-stimulated growth of pea stem segments. 
      XG11 inhibited the growth to a greater extent than did XG9. Chemically
      synthesized nona- and pentasaccharides (XG9, XG5) inhibited
      2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-stimulated elongation of pea stems to the same
      extent as the same oligosaccharides isolated from xyloglucan. A chemically
      synthesized structurally related heptasaccharide that lacked a fucosyl-galactosyl
      side chain did not, unlike the identical heptasaccharide isolated from
      xyloglucan, significantly inhibit 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-stimulated
      growth.

TI  - Molecular size and separability features of pea cell wall polysaccharides :
      implications for models of primary wall structure.
PG  - 357-68
AB  - Relative molecular size distributions of pectic and hemicellulosic
      polysaccharides of pea (Pisum sativum cv Alaska) third internode primary walls
      were determined by gel filtration chromatography. Pectic polyuronides have a peak
      molecular mass of about 1100 kilodaltons, relative to dextran standards. This
      peak may be partly an aggregate of smaller molecular units, because demonstrable 
      aggregation occurred when samples were concentrated by evaporation. About 86% of 
      the neutral sugars (mostly arabinose and galactose) in the pectin cofractionate
      with polyuronide in gel filtration chromatography and diethylaminoethyl-cellulose
      chromatography and appear to be attached covalently to polyuronide chains,
      probably as constituents of rhamnogalacturonans. However, at least 60% of the
      wall's arabinan/galactan is not linked covalently to the bulk of its
      rhamnogalacturonan, either glycosidically or by ester links, but occurs in the
      hemicellulose fraction, accompanied by negligible uronic acid, and has a peak
      molecular mass of about 1000 kilodaltons. Xyloglucan, the other principal
      hemicellulosic polymer, has a peak molecular mass of about 30 kilodaltons (with a
      secondary, usually minor, peak of approximately 300 kilodaltons) and is mostly
      not linked glycosidically either to pectic polyuronides or to arabinogalactan.
      The relatively narrow molecular mass distributions of these polymers suggest
      mechanisms of co- or postsynthetic control of hemicellulose chain length by the
      cell. Although the macromolecular features of the mentioned polymers individually
      agree generally with those shown in the widely disseminated sycamore cell primary
      wall model, the matrix polymers seem to be associated mostly noncovalently rather
      than in the covalently interlinked meshwork postulated by that model. Xyloglucan 
      and arabinan/galactan may form tightly and more loosely bound layers,
      respectively, around the cellulose microfibrils, the outer layer interacting with
      pectic rhamnogalacturonans that occupy interstices between the
      hemicellulose-coated microfibrils.

TI  - ADP-Glucose Transport by the Chloroplast Adenylate Translocator Is Linked to
      Starch Biosynthesis.
PG  - 1565-72
AB  - In organello starch biosynthesis was studied using intact chloroplasts isolated
      from spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea). Immunoblot analysis using a specific
      antiserum against the mitochondrial adenylate (ADP/ATP) translocator of
      Neurospora crassa shows the presence of an adenylate translocator protein in the 
      chloroplast envelope membranes, similar to that existing in mitochondria and
      amyloplasts from cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus). The double
      silicone oil layer-filtering centrifugation technique was employed to study the
      kinetic properties of adenylate transport in the purified chloroplasts; ATP, ADP,
      AMP, and most importantly ADP-Glc were shown to be recognized by the adenylate
      translocator. Similar to the situation with sycamore amyloplasts, only ATP and
      ADP-Glc uptake was inhibited by carboxyatractyloside, an inhibitor of the
      mitochondrial adenylate translocator. Evidence is presented to show that the
      ADP-Glc transported into the chloroplast stroma is utilized for starch synthesis 
      catalyzed by starch synthase (ADP-Glc:1,4-alpha-d-glucan
      4-alpha-d-glucosyltransferase). The high activity of sucrose synthase producing
      ADP-Glc observed in the extrachloroplastic fractions suggests that starch
      biosynthesis in chloroplasts may be coupled with the direct import of ADP-Glc
      from the cytosol.

      comparison of arboreal and nonarboreal microenvironments.
PG  - 181-98
AB  - For years the medical profession has recognized a relationship between fungal
      airspora and the incitement of respiratory allergies. An evaluation of outdoor
      fungal airspora on an eastern Ohio campus during June 1988 revealed significant
      differences in quality and quantity with respect to microenvironments. Type of
      vegetation, diurnal periodicities, and daily weather conditions affected the
      airspora at each site. Shaded lawns within groves and windbreaks, unshaded lawns,
      and asphalt-covered parking lots presented varying dynamics for fungal spore
      liberation. Unshaded lawns produced airspora most abundantly during morning and
      least abundantly during afternoon. Arboreal sites produced airspora most
      prolifically at midday. A deciduous sycamore grove produced fewer afternoon
      airspora than evergreen pine and arborvitae stands. Evening airspora at all
      vegetated sites increased after experiencing afternoon troughs. Frequently
      encountered molds included Cladosporium spp., brightly pigmented sterile mycelia,
      and Alternaria spp.

      synthase.
PG  - 233-7
AB  - The standardized enzyme coupling method for assaying sucrose synthase activities 
      in the direction of sucrose cleavage was reexamined using enzyme preparations
      from cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and spinach leaves
      (Spinacea oleracea). Both ATP and Tris, commonly utilized in assay systems to
      measure sucrose synthase, were found to inhibit non-competitively the
      ADPG-synthesizing activities of the enzyme. Upon substituting ATP by either GTP
      or UTP, and Tris by HEPES, we found that the sucrose synthase is capable of
      producing ADPG effectively, recognizing ADP as the principal substrate (Km = 5.3 
      microM (sycamore) and 16.8 microM (spinach]. The Vmax value for the synthesis of 
      ADPG clearly surpasses the Vmax observed for the synthesis of UDPG by the enzyme.
      It was found that UDP is not inhibitory on the synthesis of ADPG by SS, which
      behaves allosterically with respect to the concentration level of sucrose.

TI  - Filtering centrifugation through two layers of silicone oil: a method for the
      kinetic analysis of rapid metabolite transport in organelles.
PG  - 357-63
AB  - Kinetic studies of ATP uptake in amyloplasts from sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus
      L.) have been performed with a newly developed method of centrifugation through a
      double layer of silicone oil; the results are compared with the frequently used
      method of centrifugation through a single layer. The present technique employs
      two separate silicone layers: the upper one prevents mixing of the organelle
      preparation with the incubation layer, which contains the metabolites, and the
      lower one prevents mixing of the incubation and pelleting layers. Incubation of
      the organelles takes place in the incubation layer after the upper layer of
      silicone inverts during centrifugation. Depending on the speed of centrifugation,
      incubation periods as short as 1 sec and as long as 2 min can be achieved. High
      reproducibility and accuracy, acquisition of multiple data in a single
      centrifugation, and maintenance of structural integrity and metabolic activity of
      the organelles make the technique advantageous for the analysis of metabolite
      transport in amyloplasts and other kinds of organelles.

TI  - Simulations of the static and dynamic molecular conformations of xyloglucan. The 
      role of the fucosylated sidechain in surface-specific sidechain folding.
PG  - 195-215
AB  - The hemicellulosic polysaccharide xyloglucan binds with a strong affinity to
      cellulosic cell wall microfibrils, the resulting heterogeneous network
      constituting up to 50% of the dry weight of the cell wall in dicotyledonous
      plants. To elucidate the molecular details of this interaction, we have performed
      theoretical potential energy calculations of the static and dynamic equilibrium
      conformations of xyloglucan using the GEGOP software. In particular, we have
      evaluated the preferred sidechain conformations of hexa-, octa-, deca- and
      heptadecasaccharide model fragments of xyloglucan for molecules with a
      cellulose-like, flat, glucan backbone, and a cellobiose-like, twisted, glucan
      backbone conformation. For the flat backbone conformation the determination of
      static equilibrium molecular conformations revealed a tendency for sidechains to 
      fold onto one surface of the backbone, defined here as the H1S face, in the
      fucosylated region of the polymer. This folding produces a molecule that is
      sterically accessible on the opposite face of the backbone, the H4S face.
      Typically, this folding onto the H1S surface is significantly stabilized by
      favorable interactions between the fucosylated, trisaccharide sidechain and the
      backbone, with some stabilization from adjacent terminal xylosyl sidechains. In
      contrast, the trisaccharide sidechain folds onto the H4S face of xyloglucan
      fragments with a twisted backbone conformation. Preliminary NMR data on
      nonasaccharide fragments isolated from sycamore suspension-cultured cell walls
      are consistent with the hypothesis that the twisted conformation of xyloglucan
      represents the solution form of this molecule. Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC)
      simulations were employed to assess sidechain flexibility of the
      heptadecasaccharide fragments. Simulations performed on the flat, rigid, backbone
      xyloglucan indicate that the trisaccharide sidechain is less mobile than the
      terminal xylosyl sidechains. MMC calculations on a fully relaxed molecule
      revealed a positive correlation between a specific trisaccharide sidechain
      orientation and the 'flatness' of the backbone glucosyl residues adjacent to this
      sidechain. These results suggest that the trisaccharide sidechain may play a role
      in the formation of nucleation sites that initiate the binding of these regions
      to cellulose. Based on these conformational preferences we suggest the following 
      model for the binding of xyloglucan to cellulose. Nucleation of a binding site is
      initiated by the fucosylated, trisaccharide sidechain that flattens out an
      adjacent region of the xyloglucan backbone. Upon contacting a cellulose
      microfibril this region spreads by step-wise flattening of successive segments of
      the backbone. Self-association of xyloglucan molecules in solution may be
      prevented by the low frequency of formation of these nucleation sites and the
      geometry of the molecules in solution.

PG  - 62-6
AB  - Structurally intact and metabolically competent mitochondria isolated from
      liquid-culture cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) were shown to
      incorporate ADPglucose. Employing the double silicone oil layer filtering
      centrifugation method, we examined the kinetic properties of the uptake of
      various adenylates as well as the inhibitory effects exerted by
      carboxyatractyloside, atractyloside and bongkrekic acid, known specific
      inhibitors of the mitochondrial adenylate translocator. Immunoblot patterns of
      peptides derived from the partial proteolytic digestion of the mitochondrial and 
      plastid adenylate translocators were shown to be essentially the same. We
      conclude that the molecular entities engaged in the adenylate transport system
      operating in two different organelles, mitochondria and amyloplasts, are very
      similar.

PG  - 1142-9
AB  - Incubation of amyloplasts isolated from cultured cells of sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.) with [gamma-(32)P]ATP resulted in the rapid phosphorylation
      (half-time of 40 seconds at 25 degrees Celcius) of organellar polypeptides. The
      preferred substrate for amyloplast protein kinases was Mg(2+). ATP, and recovery 
      of only [(32)P]serine after partial acid hydrolysis indicated the predominance of
      protein serine kinases in the organelle. These activities were located in the
      envelope and stromal fractions of the plastid, which showed different
      specificities toward exogenous protein substrates and distinct patterns of
      phosphorylation of endogenous polypeptides. A 66-kilodalton polypeptide,
      inaccessible to an exogenously added protease, was one of the major
      phosphorylated products found in intact amyloplasts at low [gamma-(32)P]
      adenosine triphosphate concentrations. This polypeptide represented the major
      phosphoprotein observed with the isolated envelope fraction. The patterns of
      polypeptide phosphorylation found in intact amyloplasts and chloroplasts from
      cultured cell lines of sycamore were clearly distinguishable. The overall results
      indicate the presence of protein phosphorylation systems unique to this reserve
      plastid present in nonphotosynthetic tissues.

TI  - Direct transport of ADPglucose by an adenylate translocator is linked to starch
      biosynthesis in amyloplasts.
PG  - 5769-73
AB  - Starch biosynthesis has been studied by using amyloplasts isolated from cultured 
      cells of sycamore trees (Acer pseudoplatanus L.). Highly purified intact
      amyloplasts, free from mitochondria and starch granules derived from broken
      amyloplasts, were isolated from a Percoll step gradient. Subsequently, the double
      silicone oil layer centrifugation technique was used to study adenylate transport
      in the amyloplasts. An adenylate-specific carrier was found to be active in the
      uptake of ATP, ADP, AMP, and most importantly, ADPglucose (ADP-Glc). Kinetic
      analyses showed that the uptake of these adenylates was mutually competitive with
      each other. In contrast to the mitochondrial adenylate carrier, in amyloplasts
      only ATP and ADP-Glc uptake were inhibited by carboxyatractyloside. Evidence is
      presented that the ADP-Glc transported into the amyloplast stroma can be used in 
      starch synthesis catalyzed by starch synthase (ADP-Glc:1,4-alpha-D-glucan
      4-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.21). We propose that starch biosynthesis 
      in amyloplasts is tightly coupled with the direct transport of ADP-Glc
      synthesized in the cytosol by sucrose synthase (ADP-Glc:D-fructose
      2-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.13)

TI  - A new undecasaccharide subunit of xyloglucans with two alpha-L-fucosyl residues.
PG  - 117-29
AB  - A new oligosaccharide subunit of xyloglucan was isolated from the
      beta-(1----4)-endoglucanase digestion products of the xyloglucan in what is
      referred to as "sycamore extracellular polysaccharides" and found to be an
      undecasaccharide having two terminal alpha-L-fucopyranosyl residues. The
      undecasaccharide was structurally characterized by 1H-n.m.r. spectroscopy,
      fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (f.a.b.-m.s.), and glycosyl-residue and
      glycosyl-linkage composition analyses. The structure of the undecasaccharide was 
      confirmed by digesting it with a hydrolase that releases
      alpha-D-Xylp-(1----6)-D-Glc from the non-reducing end of xyloglucan
      oligosaccharides.

TI  - Cs-134/137 contamination and root uptake of different forest trees before and
      after the Chernobyl accident.
PG  - 147-57
AB  - The Cs-134/137 activities were measured from different tree organs of spruce,
      larch and sycamore maple. Two locations in South Bavaria were monitored during a 
      period of 2.5 years following the Chernobyl accident. Samples taken in 1985 allow
      to determine the Cs-137 contamination before the accident. Increasing Cs-137
      activities from older to younger needle years of Picea abies caused by
      root-uptake of the global weapons' fallout are due to the high phloem mobility of
      this element and the remaining of the needles at the tree for about 6-7 years. In
      contrast, the Cs-137 activity was much smaller in leaves of larch and sycamore
      maple. After the Chernobyl accident, the higher contamination of spruce greater
      than larch greater than sycamore maple is dependent on the roughness of bark,
      absolute bark surface and the existence of leaves during the deposition of
      Chernobyl-derived radioactivity. The Cs-134/137 activity (Bq/kg d.w.) was about
      25-times higher in bark compared to wood of Picea abies and 1.5-4.7 times higher 
      in directly contaminated twig-axes than in leaves. Till the end of the
      investigation the major contamination of the shoots was due to direct deposition 
      of cesium on the trees. A maximum of 5-15% of the total activity of the directly 
      contaminated branches of the plants was calculated to be part of root-uptake,
      depending on the amount of initial retention. 20% of the translocated cesium into
      new leaves of larch and about 50% into sycamore maple resulted from root-uptake
      2.5 years after the accident.

      treated by hypomethylating base analog.
PG  - 513-20
AB  - The selective suppression of photosynthetic genes in both the nuclear and plastid
      genomes of the nonphotosynthetic white wild-type cell line of sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus) has been found to be inversely related to the presence of a
      variety of methylated bases, especially 5-methylcytosine (5-MeCyt) and
      N6-methyladenine (N6-MeAde), localized in regions of the plastid genome
      containing silent genes. We used hypomethylating base analogs to manipulate the
      level of cytosine and adenine methylation in the white cells of sycamore, and
      examined the effects of changes in methylation on gene expression. Treatment with
      5-azacytidine (5-AzaCyd) and N6-benzyladenine (N6-BzlAde) decreased cytosine and 
      adenine methylation. This was accompanied by restoration of transcriptional
      activity in photosynthetic genes which are usually suppressed. Both 5-MeCyt and
      N6-MeAde suppressed nuclear gene expression, but only 5-MeCyt suppressed plastid 
      gene expression.

TI  - Transient accumulation of asparagine in sycamore cells after a long period of
      sucrose starvation.
PG  - 717-22
AB  - The mobilization of stored carbohydrates (sucrose and starch) and proteins during
      sucrose starvation was studied with sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells. When
      almost all the intracellular carbohydrate pools had disappeared, the cell protein
      content declined progressively whereas asparagine determined by either (13)C
      nuclear magnetic resonance or reversed phase high performance liquid
      chromatography increased steadily. After a long period of sucrose starvation, the
      most intense resonances in the (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were from
      citrate and asparagine. The total amounts of asparagine (expressed as nitrogen)
      and free amino acids that appeared after a long period of sucrose deprivation
      corresponded roughly to the total amount of protein (expressed as nitrogen), that
      disappeared within the same period of time. Addition of sucrose in the culture
      medium after a long period of sucrose starvation led to a disappearance of
      asparagine. These results suggest therefore that the presence of asparagine in
      plant cells in large excess should be considered as a good marker of protein
      utilization after a long period of sucrose starvation and is very likely related 
      to stress.

TI  - Enzyme Sets of Glycolysis, Gluconeogenesis, and Oxidative Pentose Phosphate
      Pathway Are Not Complete in Nongreen Highly Purified Amyloplasts of Sycamore
      (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) Cell Suspension Cultures.
PG  - 538-44
AB  - Differential centrifugation and Percoll-gradient centrifugation of protoplast
      lysates of suspension-cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) yielded
      pure amyloplasts. Contamination of the final amyloplast preparation by foreign
      compartments was assessed by measuring marker enzyme activities. The activity of 
      alkaline pyrophosphatase was taken as a 100% plastid marker; relative to this
      marker, mitochondria (cytochrome c oxidase) averaged 0.34%, microbodies
      (catalase) 0.61%, and cytosol (alcohol dehydrogenase) 0.09%. Enzymatic activities
      of the glycolytic, gluconeogenic, pentose phosphate and the starch degradation
      pathways were found to be present in these amyloplast extracts in appreciable
      amounts. But the pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase and
      phosphoglyceromutase were judged to be essentially absent from amyloplasts
      because the activities of these enzymes were not enriched above the level of
      contaminating enzymatic activities in the amyloplast fractions. Additionally, the
      in vitro activities of starch phosphorylase, ATP dependent phosphofructokinase,
      NAD dependent glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase, and glucose-6 phosphate
      dehydrogenase did not seem to support carbon fluxes from starch to triose
      phosphates as calculated from the rate of starch disappearance during carbon
      starvation of the cells. These results provide additional, indirect evidence for 
      the recently emerged view that, in addition to the well known
      phosphate-triosephosphate translocator, another hexose phosphate and possibly
      also an ATP/ADP translocating system play major roles in nongreen plastids.

TI  - DNA methylation is a determinative element of photosynthesis gene expression in
      amyloplasts from liquid-cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.).
PG  - 285-93
AB  - Transcriptional regulation has been shown to operate as a selective control
      mechanism of expression of photosynthetic genes in the nonphotosynthetic
      plastids, amyloplasts, of a white-wild cell line of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus
      L.). To elaborate the mechanisms governing the transcriptional regulation at the 
      molecular level, we have examined the template activity of the amyloplast DNA
      compared to the chloroplast DNA by using the in vitro run-off transcription assay
      system with extracts of the two plastid types. The results of these assays
      clearly indicate that most of the amyloplast DNA regions do not serve as a
      template for the in vitro transcription regardless of the plastid extracts; this 
      is in contrast to the chloroplast DNA which serves as an active template. It is
      highly likely that the template activity of amyloplast DNA per se is the
      modulating element of transcriptional regulation. Parallel experiments
      determining the DNA base content by HPLC analysis have shown that a variety of
      methylated bases, especially 5-methylcytosine, are localized in the DNA regions
      containing suppressed genes of the amyloplast genome. In sharp contrast,
      methylated bases were undetectable in the expressed gene regions of amyloplast
      and whole chloroplast genomes. The overall findings strongly support the notion
      that DNA methylation is involved in the selective suppression of photosynthetic
      genes in the nonphotosynthetic plastids of cultured sycamore cells.

TI  - Expression of photosynthetic genes is distinctly different between chloroplasts
      and amyloplasts in the liquid-cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus
      L.).
PG  - 273-83
AB  - A nonphotosynthetic, white-wild cell line of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.)
      contains amyloplasts as the only kind of plastid, whereas a photosynthetically
      competent green variant cell line contains only chloroplasts. Transcripts of both
      nuclear and plastid genes for photosynthetic components in the white cells were
      not detectable in contrast to those in the green cells. To investigate the
      limiting step (s) behind these diminished levels of transcripts, we have
      performed in vivo pulse-chase labeling of RNA in both cell types. These studies
      indicated that the rates of incorporation of [3H]uridine and nucleotide pool
      sizes were indistinguishable between the two cell lines. Transcripts of certain
      nuclear (rbcS, cab, psbO) and plastid (rbcL) genes in the white cell were not
      detectable. We infer from these data that transcriptional regulation entails an
      important role in controlling photosynthetic RNA levels. Related analyses
      exploiting plastid run-on transcription have provided supporting evidence that
      the transcription of the amyloplast genome in the white cell is greatly
      suppressed in contrast to that of the chloroplast genome in the green cell. The
      results support a model of selective suppression of photosynthesis genes in
      nonphotosynthetic higher plant cells, and indicate that gene expression in such a
      system is primarily controlled at the transcriptional level.

      studies.
PG  - 4280-3
AB  - Phosphocholine (PC) is an abundant primary form of organic phosphate that is
      transported in plant xylem sap. Addition of PC to the perfusate of compressed
      Pi-starved sycamore cells monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy resulted in an
      accumulation of PC and all the other phosphate esters in the cytoplasmic
      compartment. Addition of hemicholinium-3, an inhibitor of choline uptake, to the 
      perfusate inhibited PC accumulation but not inorganic phosphate (Pi). When the
      Pi-starved cells were perfused with a medium containing either Pi or PC, the
      resulting Pi distribution in the cell was the same. Addition of choline instead
      of PC to the perfusate of compressed cells resulted in an accumulation of PC in
      the cytoplasmic compartment from choline kinase activity. In addition, PC
      phosphatase activity has been discovered associated with the cell wall. These
      results indicate that PC was rapidly hydrolyzed outside the cell and that choline
      and Pi entered the cytosolic compartment where choline kinase re-forms PC.

TI  - Application of an efficient strategy with a phage lambda vector for constructing 
      a physical map of the amyloplast genome of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus).
PG  - 172-9
AB  - Amyloplasts were isolated from a heterotrophic culture cell line of a woody
      plant, sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), and their DNA was purified. Conventional
      procedures for making a physical map were not easily applicable to the amyloplast
      DNA, since the yield of DNA was too low and the presence of repeated sequences
      interfered with the analysis. Therefore, the pieces of amyloplast DNA starting
      with a few micrograms of DNA were cloned in the lambda Fix vector, which is a
      derivative of lambda EMBL vectors improved for efficient cloning and gene
      walking. Cloned DNA fragments were randomly picked, mapped for restriction
      endonuclease sites by a refined procedure, and combined by overlapping their
      physical maps. The DNA library was also subjected to screening by gene walking
      using promoters recognized by T3 and T7 RNA polymerases in the vector to fill the
      gaps between sequences determined by overlapping the physical maps. In this way, 
      we constructed the entire DNA library and the complete physical map of the
      amyloplast DNA. The sycamore amyloplast genome was composed of 141.7-kbp
      nucleotides with the same gene arrangement as that of tobacco chloroplasts.

TI  - The role of high-mannose and complex asparagine-linked glycans in the secretion
      and stability of glycoproteins.
PG  - 96-104
LID - 10.1007/BF02411415 [doi]
AB  - Suspension-cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) secrete a number
      of acid hydrolases and other proteins that have both highmannose and complex
      asparagine-linked glycans. We used affinity chromatography with concanavalin A
      and an antiserum specific for complex glycans in conjunction with in
      vivo-labeling studies to show that all of the secreted proteins carry glycans.
      The presence of complex glycans on secretory proteins indicates that they are
      passing through the Golgi complex on the way to the extracellular compartment.
      The sodium ionophore, monensin, did not block the transport of proteins to the
      extracellular medium, even though monensin efficiently inhibited the
      Golgi-mediated processing of complex glycans. The inhibition of N-glycosylation
      by tunicamycin reduced by 76% to 84% the accumulation of newly synthesized (i.e. 
      radioactively labeled) protein that was secreted by the sycamore cells, while
      cytoplasmic protein biosynthesis was not affected by this antibiotic. However, in
      the presence of glycoprotein-processing inhibitors, such as castanospermine and
      deoxymannojirimycin, the formation of complex glycans was prevented but
      glycoprotein secretion was unchanged. These results support the conclusion that
      N-linked glycan processing is not necessary for sorting, but glycosylation is
      required for accumulation of secreted proteins in the extracellular compartment.

TI  - Molecular organization and clustering of cell-wall-bound enzymes as a source of
      kinetic apparent co-operativity.
PG  - 281-90
AB  - When fixed charges and enzyme molecules are not homogeneously distributed in a
      matrix, the degree of organization of charges, of enzyme molecules and of charges
      with respect to enzyme molecules modulate the enzyme reaction rate. The overall
      reaction velocity of the bound enzyme system may be expressed in terms of
      monovariate moments of the charge density distribution and of the bivariate
      moments of the charge and enzyme density distributions. With respect to the
      situation where fixed charges and enzyme molecules are randomly distributed in
      the matrix, the molecular organization, as expressed by the monovariate and
      bivariate moments results in an increase or a decrease, of the overall reaction
      rate, as well as in the appearance of a kinetic cooperativity. The degree of
      spatial organization of objects may be expressed quantitatively through the
      concept of minimal spanning tree. This concept may thus be applied to the
      quantification of the degree of order that may exist in the bidimensional
      distribution of enzyme molecules in a charged matrix. Primary walls of isolated
      plant cells in sterile culture behave as a polyanion and contain different
      enzymes. The spatial distribution in sycamore cell walls of an acid phosphatase
      has been studied through the concept of minimal spanning tree and shown to be
      non-randomly distributed in the polyanionic matrix, but clustered in that matrix.
      This spatial organization results in a modulation of the reaction rate of the
      cell-wall-bound phosphatase reaction. Both the theoretical and experimental
      results presented in this study leave little doubt as to the validity of the idea
      that in situ the organization of fixed charges and enzyme molecules modulate the 
      overall dynamics of enzyme reactions.

PG  - 7919-23
AB  - The transcripts of nuclear genes for the small subunit of
      ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcS), chlorophyll a/b-binding
      protein (cab), and extrinsic 33-kDa protein involved in photosystem II water
      oxidation (woxA) were not detectable in the white wild cultured cells of sycamore
      (Acer pseudoplatanus), in contrast to their high levels in the sibling green
      mutant cells and the constitutive expression of actin genes (act) in both cell
      types. We have examined the template activities of nuclear DNAs using the HeLa
      cell in vitro transcription system. All of the three photosynthesis genes from
      the green cell line and act from both cell types were well transcribed in vitro, 
      but these photosynthesis genes from the white cell line were not, indicating that
      the transcriptional regulation is ascribable to DNA templates. Digestion of
      nuclear DNA with methyl-sensitive and -insensitive isoschizomeric endonucleases
      and the subsequent Southern hybridization showed that each gene has the identical
      recognition sites of restriction enzymes in the green and white cell lines, but
      some of the sites were methylated only in the photosynthesis genes in the white
      cells. There was observed a clear inverse relationship between the level of
      expressed transcripts and the extent of DNA methylation. Thus, it is inferred
      that the selective methylation of DNA is a likely mechanism for suppressing
      transcription of nuclear genes for photosynthesis in the nonphotosynthetic plant 
      cells.

TI  - Pectic Cell Wall Fragments Regulate Tobacco Thin-Cell-Layer Explant
      Morphogenesis.
PG  - 747-755
AB  - Pectic fragments of cell wall polysaccharides, released from the walls of
      suspension-cultured sycamore cells by treatment with endopolygalacturonase, were 
      tested for morphogenesis-regulating activity in a modified tobacco
      thin-cell-layer explant (TCL) bioassay (D. Mohnen, S. Eberhard, V. Marfa, N.
      Doubrava, P. Toubart, D. J. Gollin, T.A. Gruber, W. Nuri, P. Albersheim, and A.
      Darvill, manuscript submitted). The pectic fragments inhibited the formation of
      roots on TCLs grown on a root-inducing medium containing 15 micromolar
      indole-3-butyric acid and 0.5 micromolar kinetin. Addition of the pectic
      fragments to a root-inducing medium containing 7 micromolar indole-3-butyric acid
      and 0.15 micromolar kinetin caused roots to form on the basal end of TCLs. TCLs
      cultured on this medium in the absence of added pectic fragments formed roots
      along their entire length. The pectic fragments induced polar tissue enlargement 
      and the formation of flowers on TCLs cultured on transition medium. The
      flower-inducing activity was stable to heat treatment and proteolytic digestion. 
      Pectic fragments isolated from the walls of suspension-cultured tobacco cells
      were as effective as those from the walls of sycamore cells in inducing de novo
      flower formation in the TCLs. These results support the hypothesis that
      oligosaccharins from plant cell walls regulate morphogenesis.

TI  - Comparison of glycerolipid biosynthesis in non-green plastids from sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus) cells and cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) buds.
PG  - 775-83
AB  - The availability of methods to fractionate non-green plastids and to prepare
      their limiting envelope membranes [Alban, Joyard & Douce (1988) Plant Physiol.
      88, 709-717] allowed a detailed analysis of the biosynthesis of lysophosphatidic 
      acid, phosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol and monogalactosyl-diacylglycerol (MGDG) 
      in two different types of non-green starch-containing plastids: plastids isolated
      from cauliflower buds and amyloplasts isolated from sycamore cells. An enzyme
      [acyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein):sn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase)
      recovered in the soluble fraction of non-green plastids transfers oleic acid from
      oleoyl-ACP to the sn-1 position of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate to form
      lysophosphatidic acid. Then a membrane-bound enzyme
      (acyl-ACP:monoacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase), localized in the
      envelope membrane, catalyses the acylation of the available sn-2 position of
      1-oleoyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate by palmitic acid from palmitoyl-ACP. Therefore
      both the soluble phase and the envelope membranes are necessary for acylation of 
      sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. The major difference between cauliflower (Brassica
      oleracea) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) membranes is the very low level of
      phosphatidate phosphatase activity in sycamore envelope membrane. Therefore, very
      little diacylglycerol is available for MGDG synthesis in sycamore, compared with 
      cauliflower. These findings are consistent with the similarities and differences 
      described in lipid metabolism of mature chloroplasts from 'C18:3' and 'C16:3'
      plants (those with MGDG containing C18:3 and C16:3 fatty acids). Sycamore
      contains only C18 fatty acids in MGDG, and the envelope membranes from sycamore
      amyloplasts have a low phosphatidate phosphatase activity and therefore the
      enzymes of the Kornberg-Pricer pathway have a low efficiency of incorporation of 
      sn-glycerol 3-phosphate into MGDG. By contrast, cauliflower contains MGDG with
      C16:3 fatty acid, and the incorporation of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate into MGDG by
      the enzymes associated with envelope membranes is not limited by the
      phosphatidate phosphatase. These results demonstrate that: (1) non-green plastids
      employ the same biosynthetic pathway as that previously established for
      chloroplasts (the formation of glycerolipids is a general property of all
      plastids, chloroplasts as well as non-green plastids), (2) the envelope membranes
      are the major structure responsible for the biosynthesis of phosphatidic acid,
      diacylglycerol and MGDG, and (3) the enzymes of the envelope Kornberg-Pricer
      pathway have the same properties in non-green starch-containing plastids as in
      mature chloroplasts from C16:3 and C18:3 plants.

TI  - Immunochemical Analysis Shows That an ATP/ADP-Translocator Is Associated with the
      Inner-Envelope Membranes of Amyloplasts from Acer pseudoplatanus L.
PG  - 1024-7
AB  - Pure preparations of intact amyloplasts and chloroplasts, free from mitochondrial
      contamination, were isolated from cultured cells of the white-wild and
      green-mutant lines of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), respectively. A specific
      rabbit antiserum against yeast mitochondrial cytochrome c(1) only cross-reacted
      with mitochondrial membranes from the white-wild sycamore cells. The outer and
      inner envelope-membranes of the two plastid-types were isolated and subsequently 
      analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to
      characterize polypeptide patterns in each fraction. Analysis by immunoblotting
      clearly showed that antiserum against the 29-kilodalton inorganic orthophosphate 
      translocator isolated from pea chloroplasts cross-reacted with a 31-kilodalton
      polypeptide residing in the inner-envelope membranes from both sycamore
      chloroplasts and amyloplasts. In contrast, antiserum against the
      ADP/ATP-translocator isolated from mitochondria of Neurospora crassa yielded a
      positive signal with a 32-kilodalton polypeptide in the inner-membranes isolated 
      from amyloplasts, but not green-mutant chloroplasts. We propose that this
      32-kilodalton polypeptide in the amyloplast envelope is a putative
      ATP/ADP-translocator and its possible functional significance is discussed.

      nuclear magnetic resonance studies.
PG  - 4888-95
AB  - When sycamore cells were suspended in basal medium containing choline, the latter
      was taken up by the cells very rapidly. A facilitated diffusion system
      appertained at low concentrations of choline and exhibited Michaelis-Menten
      kinetics. At higher choline concentrations simple diffusion appeared to be the
      principal mode of uptake. Addition of choline to the perfusate of compressed
      sycamore cells monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy resulted in a dramatic
      accumulation of P-choline in the cytoplasmic compartment containing choline
      kinase and not in the vacuole. The total accumulation of P-choline over a 10-h
      period exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics. During this period, in the absence of
      Pi in the perfusion medium there was a marked depletion of glucose-6-P, and the
      cytoplasmic Pi resonance disappeared almost completely. When a threshold of
      cytoplasmic Pi was attained, the phosphorylation of choline was sustained by the 
      continuous release of Pi from the vacuole although at a much lower rate. However,
      when 100 microM inorganic phosphate was present in the perfusion medium,
      externally added Pi was preferentially used to sustain P-choline synthesis. It is
      clear, therefore, that cytosolic choline kinase associated with a
      carrier-mediated transport system for choline uptake appeared as effective
      systems for continuously trapping cytoplasmic Pi including vacuolar Pi entering
      the cytoplasm.

TI  - Effects of insect damage on photosynthesis, transpiration and SO2 uptake by
      sycamore.
PG  - 136-9
LID - 10.1007/BF00789943 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the effects of damage by the typhlocybine
      leafhopperOssiannilssonola callosa on the physiology of sycamore seedlings.
      Feeding by 20 adult leafhoppers for four days produced stippling damage of about 
      10% of total leaf area. Measurements immediately following removal of the
      leafhoppers showed a 22% decrease in photosynthesis, 25% decrease in daytime rate
      of water loss and a 34% increase in night-time rate of water loss, probably due
      to impaired stomatal function. Sixteen days later control of stomatal function
      was largely regained with rates of photosynthesis similar to the control plants
      and slightly higher rates of water loss (6.6% day, 18.0% night) attributable to
      the still-open feeding punctures of the leafhoppers. Daytime SO2 uptake was
      similar in damaged and control plants but at night the damaged plants showed a
      35% increase in uptake. The hypothesis that leafhopper damage is responsible for 
      this increase is supported by a positive relationship between uptake rate and
      area of leaf stippled. The physiological effects of leafhopper feeding are
      greater than the visible damage suggests and the effects are particularly serious
      when the damage is fresh. Increased rate of air pollutant entry to damaged plants
      is also a problem, again most marked when damage is fresh.

TI  - Structure of Plant Cell Walls : XXVI. The Walls of Suspension-Cultured Sycamore
      Cells Contain a Family of Rhamnogalacturonan-I-Like Pectic Polysaccharides.
PG  - 421-8
AB  - Considerable information has been obtained about the primary structures of
      suspension-cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cell-wall pectic
      polysaccharides, i.e. rhamnogalacturonan I, rhamnogalacturonan II, and
      homogalacturonan. However, these polysaccharides, which are solubilized from the 
      walls by endo-alpha-1,4-polygalacturonase, account for only about half of the
      pectic polysaccharides known to be present in sycamore cell walls. We now report 
      that, after exhaustive treatment with endo-alpha-1,4-polygalacturonase,
      additional pectic polysaccharides were extracted from sycamore cell walls by
      treatment with Na(2)CO(3) at 1 and 22 degrees C. These previously uncharacterized
      polysaccharides accounted for approximately 4% of the cell wall. Based on the
      glycosyl and glycosyl-linkage compositions and the nature of the products
      obtained by treating the quantitatively predominant NaCO(3)-extracted
      polysaccharides with lithium metal dissolved in ethylenediamine, the
      polysaccharides were found to strongly resemble rhamnogalacturonan I. However,
      unlike rhamnogalacturonan I that characteristically had equal amounts of 2- and
      2,4-linked rhamnosyl residues in its backbone, the polysaccharides extracted in
      Na(2)CO(3) at 1 degrees C had markedly disparate ratios of 2- to 2,4-linked
      rhamnosyl residues. We concluded that polysaccharides similar to
      rhamnogalacturonan I but with different degrees of branching are present in the
      walls of suspension-cultured sycamore cells.

PG  - 429-37
LID - 10.1007/BF02027802 [doi]
AB  - Understory biomass heterogeneity underPlatanus occidentalis L.,Quercus alba
      L.,Celtis occidentalis Pursh., andUlmus americana L. was studied. Soil pH, Ca,
      Mg, Mn, Cu, NH4 nitrogen, total N, and soil moisture were significantly different
      under all dominant species. The pattern of soil moisture levels under different
      tree species was not consistent from one sampling period to the next. The
      aboveground biomass of understory vegetation also varied significantly under
      different tree species and was not correlated with variation in any of the soil
      properties. Maximum understory biomass gain (340%) from May to September occurred
      under oak trees, where soil moisture and most nutrients were the lowest. On the
      other hand, sycamore and hackberry had continuous release of allelochemics and
      the smallest understory biomass gain (103%) during the growing season, even
      though soil under both species had more moisture and nutrients than the soils
      under white oak. Eliminating all the factors studied leads to the conclusion that
      organic substances released in the immediate environment of dominant trees and
      their litter influenced soils and associated herb growth. In each dominant niche 
      system, understory species may have to develop their own system ("microniche") to
      minimize the stresses of competition and allelochemics.

TI  - Preparation and characterization of envelope membranes from nongreen plastids.
PG  - 709-17
AB  - We have developed a reliable procedure for the purification of envelope membranes
      from cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L.) bud plastids and sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.) cell amyloplasts. After disruption of purified intact
      plastids, separation of envelope membranes was achieved by centrifugation on a
      linear sucrose gradient. A membrane fraction, having a density of 1.122 grams per
      cubic centimeter and containing carotenoids, was identified as the plastid
      envelope by the presence of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase. Using
      antibodies raised against spinach chloroplast envelope polypeptides E24 and E30, 
      we have demonstrated that both the outer and the inner envelope membranes were
      present in this envelope fraction. The major polypeptide in the envelope
      fractions from sycamore and cauliflower plastids was identified immunologically
      as the phosphate translocator. In the envelope membranes from cauliflower and
      sycamore plastids, the major glycerolipids were monogalactosyldiacylglycerol,
      digalactosyldiacylglycerol, and phosphatidylcholine. Purified envelope membranes 
      from cauliflower bud plastids and sycamore amyloplasts also contained a
      galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase, enzymes for phosphatidic acid
      and diacylglycerol biosynthesis, acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase, and acyl-coenzyme 
      A synthetase. These results demonstrate that envelope membranes from nongreen
      plastids present a high level of homology with chloroplasts envelope membranes.

AB  - Amyloplast envelope membranes isolated from cultured, white-wild cells of
      sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) have been found to contain a Mg(2+)-ATPase,
      ranging in specific activity from 5 to 30 nanomoles per minute per milligram
      protein. This ATPase hydrolyzes a broad range of nucleoside triphosphates,
      whereas it hydrolyzes nucleoside mono- and diphosphates poorly, if at all. The
      ATPase activity was stimulated by several divalent cations, including Mg(2+),
      Mn(2+) and Ca(2+), whereas it was not affected by Sr(2+), K(+), or Na(+). The
      K(m) for total ATP was 0.6 millimolar, and the activity showed a broad pH optimum
      between 7.5 and 8.0. The ATPase was insensitive to N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide 
      and oligomycin, but it was inhibited by vanadate. All these characteristics are
      basically similar to those reported previously for the Mg(2+)-ATPase of the
      chloroplast inner-envelope membrane. Likewise, the amyloplast envelope enzyme was
      shown to be located specifically on the inner envelope membrane. The amyloplast
      envelope membranes were chemically modified with a series of unique affinity
      labeling reagents, the adenosine polyphosphopyridoxals (M Tagaya, T Fukui 1986
      Biochemistry 25: 2958-2964). About 90% of the ATPase activity was lost when the
      envelope membranes were preincubated with 0.1 millimolar adenosine
      triphosphopyridoxal. Notably, the enzyme was protected completely from
      inactivation in the presence of its substrate, ATP. In contrast, both adenosine
      diphosphopyridoxal and pyridoxal phosphate caused much less of an inhibitory
      effect. This greater relative reactivity of the triphosphopyridoxal analog is
      similar to that reported previously with Escherichia coli F(1) ATPase (T Noumi et
      al. 1987 J Biol Chem 262: 7686-7692).

TI  - DNA methylation as a mechanism of transcriptional regulation in nonphotosynthetic
      plastids in plant cells.
PG  - 4750-4
AB  - Transcription of amyloplast DNA in a heterotrophic line of cultured cells of
      sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) appeared to be greatly suppressed. A mutant
      cell line obtained from the heterotrophic line is green and autotrophic. Heavy
      modification of amyloplast DNA with a variety of methylated bases was
      demonstrated by analysis of the acid hydrolysate of DNA by high-performance
      liquid chromatography, but little modification of chloroplast DNA from the green 
      line was detected. When plastid DNAs from the original and green cell lines were 
      digested with methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes, DNA methylation was detected 
      in regions containing the genes for the large subunit of
      ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL), subunits of chloroplast
      coupling factor 1 (atpA, -B, and -E), the apoprotein of P700 (psaA), and
      ribosomal protein S4 (rps4) but not the genes for 16S rRNA and the 32-kDa QB
      protein (psbA) in the original line, whereas no methylation was observed in the
      green line. The genes for which methylation was not detectable were found to be
      active as templates for in vitro transcription by Escherichia coli RNA
      polymerase, but the methylated genes were apparently inactive. Methylation of DNA
      is a likely mechanism for the regulation of expression of amyloplast DNA in
      sycamore cells.

PG  - 371-8
AB  - To study the characteristic features of the amyloplast, a uniquely differentiated
      plastid-type which synthesizes and accumulates reserve starch, in comparison with
      those of the chloroplast, these two types of plastids were isolated from
      white-wild and green-mutant protoplasts of cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus
      L.) cells, respectively. The intactness of the isolated amyloplast preparations
      was 70%. Electron microscopic ultrastructural analysis of both plastid types
      revealed unique structural features of the green-mutant chloroplasts, including
      well developed grana membranes and abundant ribosomal particles and
      plastoglobuli. After osmotic rupture of the isolated amyloplasts and
      chloroplasts, a clear separation of the envelope-membranes was achieved by
      discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Although the visible
      absorption spectra of the envelope lipid components were indistinguishable
      between the amyloplasts and chloroplasts, the envelope-membrane polypeptide
      patterns were clearly distinct as judged by denaturing electrophoresis. By
      immunoblotting analysis using the specific antiserum raised against the pea
      chloroplast 29-kilodalton Pi-translocator, the amount of this carrier-protein
      (31-kilodalton) in the white-wild amyloplast envelope-membranes was estimated to 
      be at least 10-fold less than in the green-mutant envelopes.

TI  - Facilitated transport of Mn2+ in sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells and excised
      maize root tips. A comparative 31P n.m.r. study in vivo.
PG  - 401-8
AB  - Movement of paramagnetic Mn2+ into sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells has been 
      indirectly examined by observing the line broadening exhibited in its 31P n.m.r. 
      spectra. Mn2+ was observed to pass into the vacuole, while exhibiting a very
      minor accumulation in the cytoplasm. With time, gradual leakage of phosphate from
      the vacuole to the cytoplasm was observed along with an increase in
      glucose-6-phosphate. Anoxia did not appear to affect the relative distribution of
      Mn2+ in the cytoplasm and vacuole. Under hypoxic conditions restriction of almost
      all movement of Mn2+ across the plasmalemma as well as the tonoplast was
      observed. In contrast, maize root tips showed entry and complete complexation of 
      nucleotide triphosphate by Mn2+ during hypoxia. The rate of passage of Mn2+
      across the tonoplast in both sycamore and maize root cells is approximately the
      same. However, the rates of facilitated movement across the respective plasma
      membranes appear to differ. More rapid movement of Mn2+ across the plasmalemma in
      maize root tip cells allows a gradual build-up of metal ion in the cytoplasm
      prior to its diffusion across the tonoplast. Sycamore cells undergo a slower
      uptake of Mn2+ into their cytoplasms (comparable with the rate of diffusion
      through the tonoplast), so little or no observable accumulation of Mn2+ is
      observed in this compartment.

TI  - Characterization of native and modified extensin monomers and oligomers by
      electron microscopy and gel filtration.
PG  - 848-56
AB  - We isolated hydroxyproline-rich extensin precursors from suspension-cultured
      tomato, cucumber, and sycamore-maple by salt-elution of intact cells and cell
      wall preparations. Cation exchange chromatography and HPLC gel filtration
      resolved these precursors into monomeric and oligomeric fractions, confirmed by
      amino acid analysis, immunological cross-reactivity, and TEM visualization. After
      rotary shadowing monomers appeared as flexuous rods with a contour length of 70
      to 100 nanometers and a ;persistence length' (maximum linear displacement) of 44 
      to 51 nanometers. Oligomers were larger branched assemblies with occasional
      pores. Native extensin monomers gave uniform gel filtration retention times
      (Rts), but the Rts of HF-deglycosylated monomers varied depending on
      concentration, implying ionic interaction between the highly basic deglycosylated
      monomers and a weakly cationic gel matrix. Succinylation of the deglycosylated
      monomers reversed the net charge, and restored the retention time to that of
      glycosylated monomers, confirming the ionic interaction. Succinylation enhanced
      visualization of the deglycosylated monomers, which previously were barely
      discernible flexuous rods. The persistence length:contour length ratios of
      succinylated deglycosylated monomers (tomato sdP2) and glycosylated monomers
      (sP2) were the same, implying a similar molecular flexibility for both
      glycosylated and deglycosylated monomers at room temperature. These molecular
      properties are consistent with suggestions that extensin monomers reptate into
      the wall as a transmural protein ;weft' which becomes progressively cross-linked 
      forming a network penetrated by the cellulose ;warp.'

PG  - 113-32
AB  - The locations of the O-acetyl substituents on the major nonasaccharide repeating 
      unit of the xyloglucan isolated from sycamore extracellular polysaccharides were 
      determined by a combination of analytical methods, including f.a.b.-m.s. and
      1H-n.m.r. spectroscopy. The O-2-linked-beta-D-galactosyl residue of the
      nonasaccharide was found to be the dominant site of O-acetyl substitution. Both
      mono-O-acetylated and di-O-acetylated beta-D-galactosyl residues were detected.
      The degree of O-acetylation of the beta-D-galactosyl residue, was estimated by
      1H-n.m.r. spectroscopy to be 55-60% at O-6, 15-20% at O-4, and 20-25% at O-3.
      1H-n.m.r. spectroscopy also indicated that approximately 50% of the
      beta-D-galactosyl residues are mono-O-acetylated, 25-30% are di-O-acetylated, and
      20% are not acetylated.

TI  - Expression of Amyloplast and Chloroplast DNA in Suspension-Cultured Cells of
      Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.).
PG  - 137-42
AB  - Green mutant cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), which had been selected 
      by mutagenic treatment of the white wild type, grow photoheterotrophically in
      auxin-depleted culture medium. In contrast to the wild-type cells, mutant cells
      exhibit photosynthetic O(2)-evolution activity during their growth coincident
      with increases of (a) chlorophyll, (b) protein, and (c) ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
      (RuBP) carboxylase activity. Functionally competent chloroplasts were isolated
      from the green cells. Mechanism(s) governing gene expression of amyloplast DNA in
      the heterotrophically grown white cells were compared with those of the
      chloroplast DNA isolated from the mutant cells. We have demonstrated in both
      amyloplast and chloroplast DNAs the presence of sequences homologous to the maize
      chloroplast genes for photosynthesis, including the large subunit of ribulose
      1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO)(rbcL), the 32 kDa Q(B) protein
      (PG32) (psbA), the apoprotein of P700 (psaA) and subunits of CF(1) (atpA, atpB,
      and atpE). However, employing either enzyme assays or immunological techniques,
      RuBisCO and CF(1) cannot be detected in the white wild type cells. Northern blot 
      hybridization of the RNA from the white cells showed high levels of transcripts
      for the 16S rRNA gene and low level of transcripts for psbA; based on comparison 
      with results obtained using the green mutant cells, we propose that the
      amyloplast genome is mostly inactive except for the 16S rRNA gene and psbA which 
      is presumably regulated at the transcriptional level.

TI  - Sycamore amyloplasts can import and process precursors of nuclear encoded
      chloroplast proteins.
PG  - 799-806
AB  - Amyloplasts isolated from white-wild suspension-cultured cells of sycamore (Acer 
      pseudoplatanus L.) are found to import and process the precursor of the small
      subunit (pS) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase of spinach, but
      they lack the ability to form its holoenzyme due to the absence of both the large
      subunit and its binding-protein. They also import the precursor of the 33-kDa
      extrinsic protein (p33-kDa) of the O2-evolving complex of Photosystem II from
      spinach, but process is only to an intermediate form (i33-kDa). Chloroplasts from
      green-mutant cells of sycamore process p33-kDa to its mature form in this
      heterologous system. These results suggest that the thylakoid-associated protease
      responsible for the second processing step of p33-kDa is missing in amyloplasts, 
      possibly due to the absence of thylakoid-membranes. In contrast, the apparent
      import of the precursor of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding
      apoprotein (pLHCP) from spinach was not detected. Sycamore amyloplasts may lack
      the ability to import this particular thylakoid-protein, or rapidly degrade the
      imported molecules in the absence of thylakoid-membranes for their proper
      insertion.

      a fine nylon mesh, all the protoplasts were ruptured leaving the fragile
      amyloplasts largely intact. Aconitase hydratase (citrate [isocitrate]
      hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.3) activity of sycamore cells was associated with two
      protein fractions, one present in the cytosol while the second is of
      mitochondrial origin. Chromatography on DEAE-trisacryl did not separate the
      aconitase hydratase isoenzymes. EPR studies established that both isoenzymes
      exhibited an EPR signal at g = 2.03 once oxidized.

TI  - Secretion and membrane recycling in plant cells: novel intermediary structures
      visualized in ultrarapidly frozen sycamore and carrot suspension-culture cells.
PG  - 43-57
LID - 10.1007/BF00395066 [doi]
AB  - Freeze-fracture electron microscopy of propane-jet-frozen samples has been
      employed to investigate vesicle-mediated secretion and membrane recycling events 
      in carrot (Daucus carota L.) and sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.)
      suspension-culture cells. Stabilization of the cells by means of ultrarapid
      freezing has enabled us to preserve the cells in a turgid state and to visualize 
      new intermediate membrane configurations related to these events. Indeed, many of
      the observed membrane configurations, such as flattened membrane vesicles with
      slit-shaped membrane fusion sites and horseshoe-shaped membrane infoldings,
      appear to result from the action of turgor forces on the plasma membrane.
      Individual cells exhibited great variations in numbers and types of membrane
      configurations postulated to be related to secretion and membrane-recycling
      events. In the majority of cells, the different membrane profiles displayed a
      patchy distribution, and within each patch the membrane configurations tended to 
      be of the same stage. This result indicates that secretory events are triggered
      in domains measuring from 0.1 to about 10 mum in diameter. Based on an extensive 
      analysis of the different membrane configurations seen in our samples, we have
      formulated the following model of vesicle-mediated secretion in plant cells:
      Fusion of a secretory vesicle with the plasma membrane leads to the formation of 
      a single, narrow-necked pore that increases in diameter up to about 60 nm. During
      discharge, the vesicle is flattened, forming a disc-shaped structure
      perpendicular to the plane of the plasma membrane. As the vesicle is flattened,
      the pore is converted to a slit, the maximum length of which coincides with the
      diameter of the flattened vesicle. The flattened vesicle then tips over and
      concomitantly the plasma-membrane slit becomes curved into a horseshoe-shaped
      configuration as it extends along the outer margins of the tipped-over vesicle.
      Some coated pits are present interspersed between the above-mentioned structures,
      but their numbers appear insufficient to account for an exclusively endocytotic
      mechanism of membrane recycling. Instead, our micrographs are more consistent
      with a mixed mode of recycling of membrane components to the cortical endoplamic 
      reticulum and to Golgi cisternae that involves both internalization of membrane
      by endocytosis and of individual lippid molecules by unknown mechanisms (lipid
      exchange proteins?). To this end, overall flattening out of the horseshoe-shaped 
      membrane infoldings is accompanied by a retraction and reduction in size of their
      central, tongue-like structure.

TI  - Biochemical changes during sucrose deprivation in higher plant cells.
      Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance studies.
PG  - 5000-7
AB  - An experimental arrangement was described that enables nuclear magnetic resonance
      spectra of compressed plant cells to be recorded while circulating a medium
      through the sample. The system provided a convenient arrangement for monitoring
      by 31P NMR the behavior of plant cells over a long period of time under different
      conditions such as sucrose starvation. Perfusion of compressed sycamore cells
      with sucrose-free culture medium triggered a progressive decrease in the glucose 
      6-P and uridine-5'-diphosphate-alpha-D-glucose resonances over 30 h. When almost 
      all the intracellular carbohydrate pool had disappeared the nucleotide
      triphosphate resonances decline progressively. These changes were accompanied by 
      a Pi accumulation in the vacuole and a phosphorylcholine (P-choline) accumulation
      in the cytoplasm. The very long lag phase observed for ATP and P-choline
      evolution was comparable with that observed for the progressive intracellular
      digestion of cytoplasmic constituents (Journet, E., Bligny, R. and Douce, R.
      (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3193-3199). Addition of sucrose in the circulating
      system after a long period of sucrose starvation led to a disappearance of the
      cytoplasmic Pi resonance and a marked increase in that of glucose 6-P. Under
      these conditions the vacuolar Pi pool did not fluctuate to buffer the Pi in the
      cytoplasm. The results suggest that Pi which has been sequestered in the vacuole 
      during the course of sucrose starvation is not restored to the cytoplasm for
      rapid metabolic processes. Furthermore, the presence of P-choline in plant cells 
      in large excess should be considered as a good marker of membrane utilization
      after a long period of sucrose starvation and is very likely related to stress.

AB  - The partial purification and characterization of cell wall polysaccharides
      isolated from suspension-cultured Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) cells are
      described. Extraction of isolated cell walls with 1.0 m LiCl solubilized pectic
      polysaccharides with glycosyl-linkage compositions similar to those of
      rhamnogalacturonans I and II, pectic polysaccharides isolated from walls of
      suspension-cultured sycamore cells. Treatment of LiCl-extracted Douglas fir walls
      with an endo-alpha-1,4-polygalacturonase released only small, additional amounts 
      of pectic polysaccharide, which had a glycosyl-linkage composition similar to
      that of rhamnogalacturonan I. Xyloglucan oligosaccharides were released from the 
      endo-alpha-1,4-polygalacturonase-treated walls by treatment with an
      endo-beta-1,4-glucanase. These oligosaccharides included hepta- and
      nonasaccharides similar or identical to those released from sycamore cell walls
      by the same enzyme, and structurally related octa- and decasaccharides similar to
      those isolated from various angiosperms. Finally, additional xyloglucan and small
      amounts of xylan were extracted from the endo-beta-1,4-glucanase-treated walls by
      0.5 n NaOH. The xylan resembled that extracted by NaOH from dicot cell walls in
      that it contained 2,4- but not 3,4-linked xylosyl residues. In this study, a
      total of 15% of the cell wall was isolated as pectic material, 10% as xyloglucan,
      and less than 1% as xylan. The noncellulosic polysaccharides accounted for 26% of
      the cell walls, cellulose for 23%, protein for 34%, and ash for 5%, for a total
      of 88% of the cell wall. The cell walls of Douglas fir were more similar to dicot
      (sycamore) cell walls than to those of graminaceous monocots, because they had a 
      predominance of xyloglucan over xylan as the principle hemicellulose and because 
      they possessed relatively large amounts of rhamnogalacturonan-like pectic
      polysaccharides.

TI  - Golgi-specific localization of transglycosylases engaged in glycoprotein
      biosynthesis in suspension-cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.).
PG  - 421-31
AB  - Golgi complex and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were isolated from
      suspension-cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) by stepwise
      sucrose density gradient centrifugation using protoplasts as starting material.
      The purity of the two organelle fractions isolated was assessed by measuring
      marker enzyme activities. Localization of glycolipid and glycoprotein
      glycosyltransferase activities in the isolated Golgi and ER fractions was
      examined; three glycosyltransferases, i.e., galactosyltransferase,
      fucosyltransferase, and xylosyltransferase, proved to be almost exclusively
      confined to the Golgi, whereas the ER fractions contained glycolipid
      glycosyltransferase. The Golgi complex was further subfractionated on a
      discontinuous sucrose density gradient into two components, migrating at
      densities of 1.118 and 1.127 g/cm3. The two fractions differed in their
      compositional polypeptide bands discernible from Na-dodecylsulfate gel
      electrophoresis. Galactosyltransferase distributed nearly equally between the two
      protein peaks and xylosyltransferase activities using the endogenous acceptor
      also appeared to be localized in the two subcompartments. By contrast,
      fucosyltransferase, engaged in the terminal stage of glycosylation, banded in the
      lower density fractions. Golgi-specific alpha-mannosidase, which is presumably
      engaged in the sugar trimming of Asn-N-linked glycoprotein carbohydrate core, was
      enriched fourfold in specific activity in the fractions of the higher density.
      The overall experimental results indicate that the cotranslational glycosylation 
      of Asn-N-linked glycoproteins, e.g., polyphenol oxidase (laccase), takes place in
      the ER, while subsequent post-translational processing of the oligosaccharide
      moiety proceeds successively in the two physically separable compartments of the 
      Golgi complex.

PG  - 787-94
AB  - PLANT CELL WALLS SERVE SEVERAL FUNCTIONS: they impart rigidity to the plant,
      provide a physical and chemical barrier between the cell and its environment, and
      regulate the size and shape of each cell. Chemical studies have provided
      information on the biochemical composition of the plant cell walls as well as
      detailed knowledge of individual cell wall molecules. In contrast, very little is
      known about the distribution of specific cell wall components around individual
      cells and throughout tissues. To address this problem, we have produced
      polyclonal antibodies against two cell wall matrix components; rhamnogalacturonan
      I (RG-I), a pectic polysaccharide, and xyloglucan (XG), a hemicellulose. By using
      the antibiodies as specific markers we have been able to localize these polymers 
      on thin sections of suspension-cultured sycamore cells (Acer pseudoplatanus). Our
      results reveal that each molecule has a unique distribution. XG is localized
      throughout the entire wall and middle lamella. RG-I is restricted to the middle
      lamella and is especially evident in the junctions between cells. These
      observations indicate that plant cell walls may have more distinct chemical (and 
      functional?) domains than previously envisaged.

PG  - 1008-13
AB  - Enzymes of sucrose degradation and glycolysis in cultured sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.) cells were assayed and characterized in crude extracts and
      after partial purification, in an attempt to identify pathways for sucrose
      catabolism. Desalted cell extracts contained similar activities (20-40 nanomoles 
      per milligram protein per minute) of sucrose synthase, neutral invertase,
      glucokinase, fructokinase, phosphofructokinase, and UDPglucose pyrophosphorylase 
      (assayed with 2 micromolar pyrophosphate (PPi). PPi-linked phosphofructokinase
      activity was virtually dependent upon fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and the maximum 
      activity exceeded that of ATP-linked phosphofructokinase. Hexokinase activity,
      with glucose as substrate, was highly specific for ATP, whereas fructokinase
      activity was relatively nonspecific. At 1 millimolar nucleoside triphosphate,
      fructokinase activity decreased in the order: UTP > ATP > CTP > GTP. We propose
      two pathways for sucrose degradation. One involves invertase action, followed by 
      classical glycolysis of hexose sugars, and the other is a novel pathway initiated
      by sucrose synthase. The K(m) for sucrose of sucrose synthase was severalfold
      lower than that of neutral invertase (15 versus 65 millimolar), which may
      determine carbon partitioning between the two pathways. The sucrose synthase
      pathway proposed involves cycling of uridylates and PPi. UDPglucose
      pyrophosphorylase, which is shown to be an effective ;PPi-scavenger,' would
      consume PPi and form UTP. The UTP could be then utilized in the UTP-linked
      fructokinase reaction, thereby forming UDP for sucrose synthase. The source of
      PPi is postulated to arise from the back reaction of PPi-linked
      phosphofructokinase. Sycamore cells contained a substantial endogenous pool of
      PPi (about 3 nanomoles per gram fresh weight, roughly 1/10 the amount of ATP in
      these cells), and sufficient fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (0.09 nanomole per gram
      fresh weight) to activate the PPi-linked phosphofructokinase. Possible regulation
      and energetic differences between the sucrose synthase and invertase pathways are
      discussed.

TI  - Excretion of laccase by sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells. Effects of a
      copper deficiency.
PG  - 583-8
AB  - Copper-deprived sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells do not excrete molecules of 
      active laccase in their culture medium. In the range of 2-100 micrograms of
      copper initially present per litre of nutrient solution, the total laccase
      activity measured in the cell suspensions at the end of the exponential phase of 
      growth was closely proportional to the amount of added copper. However,
      copper-deprived cells excreted the laccase apoprotein (laccase without copper) at
      the same rate as copper-supplied cells excreted the active, copper-containing,
      laccase. When the culture medium was initially supplied with limiting amounts of 
      copper, the active laccase was excreted until all copper molecules were
      metabolized. Thereafter, the laccase apoprotein was excreted. Consequently, at
      the end of the exponential phase of growth, the cell supernatants contained a
      mixture of apoprotein and copper-containing laccase. After purification and
      concentration, this mixture of copper-containing laccase (blue) and laccase
      apoprotein (slightly yellow) showed a yellow-green colour. Under copper-limiting 
      culture conditions an equivalent decrease of Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 Cu2+ was
      observed. Addition of copper to copper-deficient enzyme solutions does not result
      in a recovery of the enzyme activity. However, when added to copper-deficient
      sycamore-cell suspensions, copper induced a recovery of the excretion of active
      enzyme, at a normal rate, within about 10 h. The first molecules of active
      laccase were excreted after 3-4 h.

LID - 10.1007/BF00410367 [doi]
AB  - Leaves of birch (Betula pendula Roth) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) were 
      initiated and grown either in a simulated shadelight (80 mumol m(-2) s(-1), R/FR 
      ratio 0.28)/dark photoenvironment or a white light (250 mumol m(-2) s(-1),
      R/FR>1)/dark photoenvironment. Until the leaves were more than 50% expanded,
      growth rates (measured every 24 h) were the same for both species in both
      environments. After this time, growth rate slowed and this correlated well with a
      decrease in wall extensibility (WEX). Birch leaves in shadelight showed reduced
      surface acidification and were the first to show reduced growth. WEX under these 
      conditions was particularly low.Daily patterns of leaf growth of the two species 
      were very different. Sycamore leaves showed a slightly higher growth rate in the 
      dark than in shadelight, while birch leaves grew more rapidly in shadelight than 
      in the dark. Limitation of growth of sycamore leaves in light may be explained by
      a very high yield threshold turgor for growth (Y). The daily pattern of leaf
      growth shown by birch is more difficult to explain but the importance of a
      possible limitation of growth by solute availability and a diurnal variation in Y
      are discussed.

TI  - Association of H-Translocating ATPase in the Golgi Membrane System from
      Suspension-Cultured Cells of Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.).
PG  - 222-7
AB  - The Golgi complex and the disrupted vesicular membranes were prepared from
      suspension-cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) using protoplasts 
      as the starting material and employing linear sucrose density gradient
      centrifugation followed by osmolysis (Ali et al. [1985] Plant Cell Physiol 26:
      1119-1133). The isolated Golgi fraction was found to be enriched with marker
      enzyme activities and depleted of the activity of a typical mitochondrial marker 
      enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase. Golgi complex, and vesicular membranes derived
      thereof were found to contain the specific ATPase (specific activity of about 0.5
      to 0.7 micromoles per minute per milligram protein). Inhibitor studies suggested 
      that the ATPase of Golgi was different from plasma membrane, tonoplast and
      mitochondrial ATPases as it was not inhibited by sodium vanadate, potassium
      nitrate, oligomycin and sodium azide. The sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide further
      distinguished the Golgi ATPase from F(0) to F(1) ATPase of mitochondria. The
      internal acidification was measured by monitoring the difference in absorbance at
      550 nanometers minus 600 nanometers using neutral red as a probe. The maximum
      rate detected with Golgi and disrupted membrane system was 0.49 and 0.61 optical 
      density unit per minute per milligram protein, at pH 7.5, respectively,
      indicating that the proton pump activity was tightly associated with the Golgi
      membranes. In both cases, the acidification was inhibited 70 to 90% by various
      ionophores, indicating that the proton pump was electrogenic in nature. Both the 
      Golgi ATPase activity and ATP-dependent acidification were profoundly inhibited
      by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, which also indicate that the two activities are
      catalyzed by the same enzyme.

PG  - 1041-4
AB  - Highly purified amyloplasts were isolated from cultured cells of sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.). Incubation of amyloplasts with [gamma-(32)P]-ATP resulted in 
      the labeling of more than ten polypeptides. Pulsechase experiments showed the
      reversibility of the process with some but not all of the polypeptides. The
      phosphorylation reaction of one polypeptide, M(r) 100, was shown to be calcium
      dependent. Although exogenously added pig brain calmodulin had no effect, the
      calmodulin antagonist W-7 strongly inhibited phosphorylation of the 100
      kilodaltons polypeptide. The presence of endogenous calmodulin, about 1 to 3
      micrograms per milligram protein, in the amyloplast preparation was estimated by 
      activation of phosphodiesterase in vitro.

PG  - 1012-9
AB  - The water-soluble polysaccharides (SEPS) secreted into the medium by
      suspension-cultured sycamore cells were examined to determine whether the
      polysaccharides were the same as those present in the walls of sycamore cells.
      The SEPS were made more amenable to fractionation by treatment with a highly
      purified alpha-1,4-endopolygalacturonase (EPG). The EPG-treated SEPS were
      fractionated by anion-exchange and gelpermeation chromatography. The following
      polysaccharides were found: xyloglucan, arabinoxylan, at least two
      arabinogalactans, a rhamnogalacturonan-II-like polysaccharide, and a
      polygalacturonic acid-rich polysaccharide. The oligogalacturonide fragments
      expected from EPG-digested homogalacturonan were also identified. Evidence was
      obtained for the presence of a rhamnogalacturonan-I-like polysaccharide. All of
      the above polysaccharides have been isolated from or are believed to be present
      in sycamore cell walls. Furthermore, all of the noncellulosic polysaccharides
      known to be present in sycamore cell-walls appear to be present in the SEPS.

TI  - Biochemical changes during sucrose deprivation in higher plant cells.
PG  - 3193-9
AB  - The mobilization of stored carbohydrates (sucrose and starch) during sucrose
      starvation was studied with sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells. When sucrose
      was omitted from the nutrient medium, vacuolar sucrose was first consumed. When a
      threshold of intracellular sucrose concentration was attained the cytoplasmic
      phosphorylated compounds decreased whereas cytoplasmic Pi increased
      symmetrically. Such a situation triggered starch breakdown. When almost all the
      intracellular sucrose pool had disappeared, the cell respiration rates (normal
      and uncoupled) declined progressively. The decrease in the rate of respiration
      triggered by sucrose starvation was attributable neither to the availability of
      substrate for mitochondrial respiration nor to a decrease in the maximal rate of 
      O2 consumption by mitochondria expressed in terms of nanomole of O2 consumed per 
      min/mg of mitochondrial protein. In fact, the uncoupled respiration rates
      decreased in parallel with the decrease in total intracellular cardiolipin or
      cytochrome aa3. These results demonstrate therefore that after a long period of
      sucrose starvation the progressive decrease in the uncoupled rate of O2
      consumption by sycamore cells was attributable to a progressive diminution of the
      number of mitochondria/cell.

TI  - Is the availability of substrate for the tricarboxylic acid cycle a limiting
      factor for uncoupled respiration in sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells?
PG  - 571-6
AB  - Protoplasts obtained from sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cell suspensions were
      found to be highly intact and to retain a high rate of O2 consumption. If the
      protoplasts were taken up and expelled through a fine nylon mesh, all the
      protoplasts were ruptured, leaving the fragile amyloplasts largely intact.
      Distribution of enzymes of glycolysis in plastids and soluble phase of sycamore
      protoplasts indicated that the absolute maximum activity for each glycolytic
      enzyme under optimum conditions exceeded the estimates of the maximal rate at
      which sycamore cells oxidize triose phosphate. Passage of protoplasts through the
      fine nylon mesh produced a 3-5-fold decrease in O2 consumption. However, addition
      of saturating amounts of respiratory substrates and ADP restored an O2
      consumption equal to that observed with uncoupled intact protoplasts. Taken
      together, these results demonstrated that neither the overall capacity of the
      glycolytic enzymes in sycamore cells nor the availability of respiratory
      substrates for the mitochondria is ultimately responsible for determining the
      rate of uncoupled respiration in sycamore cells.

AB  - Four species of Geometridae showed similar consumption rates and approximate
      digestibilities (100 x ingestion-egestion/ingestion) of sycamore leaves (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.). A significant decline in E.C.I. (100 x growth/ingestion) and 
      E.C.D. (100x growth/ingestion-egestion) with increasing larval weight is
      reported. The earlier descent from the sycamore canopy ofErannis defoliaria Cl.
      andOperophtera brumata L. larvae, to pupate in the soil, in comparison
      withAlsophila aescularia D. and S. andAgriopis aurantiaria Hb. larvae is
      discussed in relation to small differences in the utilization efficiencies of
      final instar larvae. Later descending species suffered greater predation by
      wood-ants in the field site studied.

TI  - Amyloplast nucleoids in sycamore cells and presence in amyloplast DNA of
      homologous sequences to chloroplast genes.
PG  - 140-6
AB  - Employing specific dye-stain followed by fluorescence microscopy, evidence was
      obtained for the presence of amyloplast nucleoids in protoplasts as well as in
      the amyloplasts isolated from the suspension- cultured cells of sycamore (Acer
      psuedoplatanus L.), which are devoid of chlorophylls and grow heterotrophically. 
      We have isolated and partially characterized amyloplast DNA. The presence of six 
      homologous sequences to chloroplast genes encoding (i) apoprotein of P700, (ii)
      32 kDa protein (photogene 32), (iii) alpha subunit of CF1, (iv) large subunit of 
      RuBisCO, (v) beta and epsilon subunits of CF1 and (vi) 16S ribosomal RNA, has
      been revealed by hybridization experiments, using gene probes from maize
      chloroplast DNA.

TI  - Plasma membrane "rosettes" in carrot and sycamore suspension culture cells.
PG  - 87-91
AB  - Suspension culture cells of carrot, Daucus carota L., and sycamore, Acer
      pseudoplatanus L., were freeze-fractured after ultrarapid freezing without
      fixation or cryoprotection in a propane-jet freezer. Infrequently, rosettes (ca. 
      24 nm diameter) of six (occasionally five) subunits (ca. 8 nm diameter) were
      observed in P-face views of the plasma membrane of both taxa. When present,
      rosette density was approximately 1/micron 2. Generally, rosettes were less
      frequently seen on plasma membranes exhibiting numerous vesicle fusion figures.
      Due to the high quality of the freezing, cellulose microfibril impressions were
      rarely seen on either PF or EF views of the plasma membrane, thus precluding
      correlations between microfibrils on the one hand and rosettes (and terminal
      globules) on the other. The presence of rosettes in suspension culture cells of
      these two species supports the putative role of rosettes in cellulose
      biosynthesis in higher plants.

TI  - O2-triggered changes of membrane fatty acid composition have no effect on
      Arrhenius discontinuities of respiration in sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.)
      cells.
PG  - 9166-70
AB  - Sycamore cells (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) in suspension culture were grown at 25
      degrees C in culture medium containing two oxygen concentrations: 250 microM O2
      (standard conditions) and 10 microM O2 (O2-limiting conditions). The decrease of 
      O2 concentration in the culture medium did not modify significantly the relative 
      proportion of each phospholipid. In contrast, the molar proportion of fatty acids
      was dramatically changed in all lipid classes of the cell membranes; the average 
      percentage of oleate increased from 3 to 45% whereas that of linoleate decreased 
      from 49 to 22%. When normal culture conditions were restored (250 microM O2),
      oleate underwent a rapid desaturation process; the loss of oleic acid was
      associated with a stoichiometric appearance of linoleic acid at a rate of about 4
      nmol of oleate desaturated/h/10(6) cells. Under these conditions, no change in
      the Arrhenius-type plots of the rate of sycamore cell respiration was observed;
      the values of the transition temperature and of the Arrhenius activation energy
      (Ea) associated with the cell respiration as well as with the
      respiration-associated enzymes remained unchanged. Thus it was concluded that the
      fact that a strong decrease in the fraction of unsaturated fatty acid residues
      present in the mitochondria had no effect on electron transport rates and
      Arrhenius plot discontinuities casts doubt on the significance of such changes in
      terms of chilling injury. Finally it is suggested that some of the Arrhenius
      discontinuities observed at the level of membrane enzyme could be the consequence
      of intrinsic thermotropic changes in protein arrangement independent of lipid
      fluidity.

TI  - Effect of sucrose starvation on sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cell carbohydrate 
      and Pi status.
PG  - 679-84
AB  - The mobilization of stored carbohydrates during sucrose starvation was studied
      with sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells. When sucrose was omitted from the
      nutrient medium, the intracellular sucrose pool decreased rapidly during the
      first hours of the experiment, whereas the starch content remained practically
      unchanged. After 10h of sucrose starvation, starch hydrolysis replaced sucrose
      breakdown. From this moment, the phosphate-ester pool and respiration rate
      decreased with time. Conversely, the intracellular Pi concentration increased.
      31P n.m.r. of intact sycamore cells indicated that, under these conditions, most 
      of the Pi accumulated in the vacuole. These results strongly suggest that starch 
      breakdown, in contrast with sucrose hydrolysis, is not rapid enough to maintain a
      high cellular metabolism.

PG  - 295-7
AB  - Xyloglucan, isolated from the soluble extracellular polysaccharides of
      suspension-cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells, was digested with an
      endo-beta-1,4-glucanase purified from the culture fluid of Trichoderma viride. A 
      nonasaccharide-rich Bio-Gel P-2 fraction of this digest inhibited
      2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic-acid-stimulated elongation of etiolated pea stem
      segments. The inhibitory activity of this oligosaccharide fraction exhibited a
      well-defined concentration optimum between 10(-2) and 10(-1) micrograms per
      milliliter. Another fraction of the same xyloglucan digest, rich in a
      structurally related heptasaccharide, did not, at similar concentrations,
      significantly inhibit the elongation.

TI  - Is the cytosolic pi concentration a limiting factor for plant cell respiration?
PG  - 355-9
AB  - The substrate-dependent O(2) uptake by sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cell
      mitochondria in the presence of ADP and limiting Pi concentrations has been
      measured. The Pi concentration for half-maximum O(2) uptake rate was found to be 
      in the range 20 to 50 micromolar for all the substrates tested. (31)P NMR of
      intact sycamore cells indicated that the Pi concentration in the cytoplasm was in
      the range 5 to 6 millimolar, approximately 100-fold higher than the Pi
      concentration required for maximum O(2) uptake rates by isolated mitochondria.
      When sycamore cells were transferred to a culture medium devoid of Pi, the
      cytoplasmic Pi concentration decreased from 6 to less than 3 millimolar, but the 
      intact cell respiration remained practically constant for at least 4 days. These 
      results strongly suggest that, in vivo, the respiration rate of sycamore cells is
      not limited by the quantity of Pi supplied to the mitochondria.

AB  - Breakdown of chlorophylls in attached senescing sycamore leaves held in darkness 
      was significantly less over a 14-d period than that occurring in leaves exposed
      to natural light. Chlorophyll a declined more rapidly than chlorophyll b in both 
      situations, the stability of the latter being particularly increased in darkness.
      The differences between dark-maintained leaves and those exposed to light with
      respect to soluble protein, cytoplasmic RNA, and free amino-nitrogen were much
      less marked. The data indicate that chlorophyll loss during senescence is, at
      least in part, the result of a direct photochemical degradation of the pigment.

TI  - Relationship between the cytoplasm and the vacuole phosphate pool in Acer
      pseudoplatanus cells.
PG  - 143-8
AB  - The Pi concentration of Acer pseudoplatanus cells in the two major intracellular 
      compartments, the cytoplasm and the vacuole, has been studied using 31P NMR. For 
      sycamore cells containing approximately 2 mM of total Pi, the cytoplasmic Pi and 
      the vacuolar Pi concentrations were approximately 6 and 1.5 mM, respectively.
      When the cells were transferred to a phosphate-deficient medium, the vacuolar Pi 
      decreased rapidly while the cytoplasmic Pi decreased slowly during the first 48
      h, indicating that Pi in the cytoplasm was maintained at the expense of the
      vacuolar Pi. When the Pi-starved cells (i.e., those containing less than 0.5
      mumol of total Pi/g wet wt) were transferred to a medium containing 300 microM
      Pi, Pi entered the cells rapidly and accumulated in the cytoplasm. Once the
      cytoplasmic Pi pool was filled, Pi was taken up in the vacuole until the vacuole 
      Pi pool was filled. On the contrary when the non-Pi-starved cells were
      transferred to a phosphate-rich medium (i.e., containing 45 mM Pi), Pi entered
      the cells slowly by diffusion and accumulated in the vacuole but not in the
      cytoplasm. These results demonstrate that the Pi content of the cytoplasm is
      maintained at the expense of the vacuolar Pi pool when sycamore cells are
      transferred to either a phosphate-deficient or a phosphate-rich medium.

TI  - Host-Pathogen Interactions : XXIV. Fragments Isolated from Suspension-Cultured
      Sycamore Cell Walls Inhibit the Ability of the Cells to Incorporate [C]Leucine
      into Proteins.
PG  - 864-9
AB  - A bioassay to measure the incorporation of [(14)C]leucine into acid-precipitable 
      polymers of suspension-cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells is
      described. Using this assay, cell wall fragments solubilized from sycamore cell
      walls by partial acid hydrolysis are shown to contain components that inhibit the
      incorporation of [(14)C]leucine into the acid-precipitable polymers. This
      inhibition was not attributable to a suppression of [(14)C]leucine uptake. The
      effectiveness of the wall fragments in inhibiting [(14)C]leucine incorporation
      was substantially relieved by plasmolysis of the cells. Fragments released from
      starch and citrus pectin are shown not to possess such inhibitory activities.

TI  - Auxin requirements of sycamore cells in suspension culture.
PG  - 927-31
AB  - Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cell suspension cultures (strain OS) require
      2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) in their culture medium for normal growth.
      If the 2,4-D is omitted, rates of cell division are dramatically reduced and cell
      lysis may occur. Despite this ;auxin requirement,' it has been shown by gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry that the cells synthesize indol-3yl-acetic acid 
      (IAA). Changes in free 2,4-D and IAA in the cells during a culture passage have
      been monitored.There is a rapid uptake of 2,4-D by the cells during the lag phase
      leading to a maximum concentration per cell (125 nanograms per 10(6) cells) on
      day 2 followed by a decline to 45 nanograms per 10(6) cells by day 9 (middle of
      linear phase). The initial concentration of IAA (0.08 nanograms per 10(6) cells) 
      rises slowly to a peak of 1.4 nanograms per 10(6) cells by day 9 then decreases
      rapidly to 0.2 nanograms per 10(6) cells by day 15 (early declining phase) and
      0.08 nanograms per 10(6) cells by day 23 (early stationary phase).

TI  - Excretion of laccase by sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells. Purification and
      properties of the enzyme.
PG  - 489-96
AB  - A laccase-type polyphenol oxidase is excreted by sycamore cells (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.) cells. The enzyme has been purified by classical purification 
      techniques. It is a blue copper protein of Mr 97 000, containing 45% carbohydrate
      and 0.24% copper. This protein consists of one single unit and the copper content
      corresponds to four copper atoms per protein molecule. The specific activity of
      the purified extracellular sycamore-cell laccase measured at pH 6.6 (optimum pH) 
      and in the presence of 20mM-4-methhylcatechol (optimum substrate conditions)
      corresponded to an oxygen uptake of 32 000 nmol of O2/min per mg of protein.
      Under these conditions, the catalytic-centre activity of the enzyme reached 100
      s-1. The excretion of laccase by sycamore cells is significant, being about 2% of
      the total protein synthesized by the cells during the exponential phase of
      growth, and is independent of cell growth. The physiological significance and the
      problems raised by the passage of this protein across the cytoplasmic membrane
      are discussed.

TI  - Biology of Meloidogyne platani Hirschmann Parasitic on Sycamore, Platanus
      occidentalis.
PG  - 154-61
AB  - The development of Meloidogyne platani on sycamore was followed for 40 days
      (22-28 C). Juveniles penetrated the feeder roots behind the root cap and invaded 
      the vascular cylinder within 3 days after inoculation. All subsequent development
      of the nematodes and host effects occurred only within the stele. The second
      juvenile molt and sex differentiation occurred by the 17th day. Young females
      were observed by the 26th day. Eggs were observed inside the roots by the 35th
      day and were exposed to the surface of galls by the 40th day. In pathogenicity
      studies, a significant negative correlation was shown to exist between fresh
      shoot and root weights and inoculum density. Besides sycamore, white ash was the 
      only hardwood species tested to become infected. Of the herbacious plants tested,
      tobacco was heavily galled, tomato and watermelon moderately galled, and pepper
      only slightly galled. Egg production was moderate on tobacco, slight on tomato
      and watermelon, and absent on pepper.

      American Sycamore.
PG  - 84-95
AB  - Meloidogyne platani n. sp. is described and illustrated from specimens obtained
      from roots of American sycamore, Platanus occidentalis, in Virginia. This new
      species shows certain similarities with M. arenaria but differs from it by a
      number of distinctive characters. The perineal pattern of females is rounded with
      fine, wavy to zig-zag striae and raised, convoluted striae in the inner lateral
      line regions. The stylet of females is 16.5 mum long with large, rounded stylet
      knobs set off from the shaft. Males have a low head cap and smooth head region.
      The styler length is 22.0 mum, and the stylet knobs are rounded and set off from 
      the shaft. Mean second-stage juvenile length is 443.0 mum, and stylet length is
      12.2 mum. The head region of juveniles is not annulated, and the tail has a
      definite terminus. This nematode causes severe galling and reproduces well on
      sycamore. Other good hosts include white ash and tobacco cv. NC 95. M. platani n.
      sp. reproduces by mitotic parthenogenesis and has a somatic chromosome number of 
      approximately 45 (2n).

TI  - Host-Pathogen Interactions : XIX. THE ENDOGENOUS ELICITOR, A FRAGMENT OF A PLANT 
      CELL WALL POLYSACCHARIDE THAT ELICITS PHYTOALEXIN ACCUMULATION IN SOYBEANS.
PG  - 1161-9
AB  - An elicitor of phytoalexin accumulation (endogenous elicitor) is solubilized from
      purified cell walls of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr., cv. Wayne) by extracting 
      the walls with hot water or by subjecting the walls to partial acid hydrolysis.
      The endogenous elicitor obtained from soybean cell walls binds to an anion
      exchange resin. The elicitor-active material released from the resin contains
      oligosaccharides rich in galacturonic acid; small amounts of rhamnose and xylose 
      are also present. The preponderance of galacturonic acid in the elicitor-active
      fragments suggests that the elicitor is, in fact, a fragment of a pectic
      polysaccharide. This possibility is supported by the observation that treatment
      of the wall fragments with a highly purified endopolygalacturonase destroys their
      ability to elicit phytoalexin accumulation. This observation, together with other
      evidence presented in this paper, suggests that galacturonic acid is an essential
      constituent of the elicitor-active wall fragments. Endogenous elicitors were also
      solubilized by partial hydrolysis from cell walls of suspension-cultured tobacco,
      sycamore, and wheat cells.

AB  - A compound that stimulated growth of soybean callus was isolated from spring sap 
      of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.). Insufficient compound was isolated to
      permit it to be characterised. A compound with identical properties was isolated 
      from commercial maple syrup, the concentrated spring sap of Acer saccharum L. The
      compound was identified as 3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propan-1-ol
      (dihydroconiferyl alcohol, DCA). DCA was also active in the tobacco callus and
      radish leaf senescence assays, but was inactive in four other tests for cytokinin
      activity. DCA acted synergistically with kinetin to promote soybean callus
      growth. It is concluded that DCA has properties distinct from those of purine
      cytokinins.

TI  - Ionic control of immobilized enzymes. Kinetics of acid phosphatase bound to plant
      cell walls.
PG  - 357-67
AB  - When an enzyme is bound to an insoluble polyelectrolyte it may acquire novel
      kinetic properties generated by Donnan effects. It the enzyme is homogeneously
      distributed within the matrix, a variation of the electrostatic partition
      coefficient, when substrate concentration is varied, mimics either positive or
      negative co-operativity. This type of non-hyperbolic behaviour may be
      distinguished from true co-operativity by an analysis of the Hill plots. If the
      enzyme is heterogeneously distributed within the polyelectrolyte matrix, an
      apparent negative co-operativity occurs, even if the electrostatic partition
      coefficient does not vary when substrate concentration is varied in the bulk
      phase. If the partition coefficient varies, mixed positive and negative
      co-operativities may occur. All these effects must be suppressed by raising the
      ionic strength in the bulk phase. Attraction of cations by fixed negative charges
      of the polyanionic matrix may be associated with a significant decrease of the
      local pH. The magnitude of this effect is controlled by the pK of the fixed
      charges groups of the Donnan phase. The local pH cannot be much lower than the
      value of this pK. This effect may be considered as a regulatory device of the
      local pH. Acid phosphatase of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cell walls is a
      monomeric enzyme that displays classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics in free
      solution. However, when bound to small cell-wall fragments or to intact cells, it
      has an apparent negative co-operativity at low ionic strength. Moreover a slight 
      increase of ionic strength apparently activates the bound enzymes and tends to
      suppress the apparent co-operativity. At I0.1, or higher, the bound enzyme has a 
      kinetic behavior indistinguishable from that of the purified enzyme in free
      solution. These results are interpreted in the light of the Donnan theory. Owing 
      to the repulsion of the substrate by the negative charges of cell-wall
      polygalacturonates, the local substrate concentration in the vicinity of the
      bound enzyme is smaller than the corresponding concentration in bulk solution.
      The kinetic results obtained are consistent with the view that there exist at
      least three populations of bound enzyme with different ionic environments: a
      first population with enzyme molecules not submitted to electrostatic effects,
      and two other populations with molecules differently submitted to these effects. 
      The theory allows one to estimate the proportions of enzyme belonging to these
      populations, as well as the local pH values and the partition coefficients within
      the cell walls.

AB  - The activity of a beta-(1-4)-xylan synthetase, a membrane-bound enzymic system,
      was measured in particulate enzymic preparations (1,000 g and 1,000-100,000 g
      pellets) obtained from homogenates of cambial cells, differentiating xylem cells 
      and differentiated xylem cells isolated from actively growing trees of sycamore
      (Acer pseudoplatamus) and poplar (Populus robusta). The specific activity (nmol
      of xylan formed min(-1) mg(-1) of protein) as well as the activity calculated on 
      a per cell basis (nmol of xylan formed min(-1) cell(-1)) of this enzymic system, 
      markedly increased as cells differentiate from the vascular cambium to xylem.
      This increase is closely correlated with the enhanced deposition of xylan
      occurring during the formation of secondary thickening. The possible control of
      xylan synthesis during the biogenesis of plant cell wall is discussed.

LID - 10.1007/BF00384237 [doi]
AB  - Particulate enzymic preparations obtained from homogenates of differentiated
      xylem cells isolated from sycamore trees, catalyzed the formation of a
      radioactive xylan in the presence of UDP-D-[U-(14)C]xylose as substrate. The
      synthesized xylan was not dialyzable through Visking cellophane tubing.
      Successive extraction with cold water, hot water and 5% NaOH dissolved
      respectively 15, 5 and 80% of the radioactive polymer. Complete acid hydrolysis
      of the water-insoluble polysaccharide synthesized from UDP-D-[U-(14)C]xylose
      released all the radioactivity as xylose. beta-1,4-Xylodextrins, degree of
      polymerization 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, were obtained by partial acid hydrolysis (fuming
      HCl or 0.1 M HCl) of radioactive xylan. The polymer was hydrolysed to xylose,
      xylobiose and xylotriose by Driselase which contains 1,4-beta xylanase
      activities. Methylation and then hydrolysis of the xylan released two methylated 
      sugars which were identified as di-O-methyl[(14)C]xylose and
      tri-O-methyl-[(14)C]xylose, suggesting a 1-->4-linked polymer. The linkage was
      confirmed by periodate oxidation studies. The apparent Km value of the synthetase
      for UDP-D-xylose was 0.4 mM. Xylan synthetase activity was not potentiated in the
      presence of a detergent. The enzymic activity was stimulated by Mg(2+) and Mn(2+)
      ions, although EDTA in the range of concentrations between 0.01 and 1 mM did not 
      affect the reaction rate. It appears that the xylan synthetase system associated 
      with membranes obtained from differentiated xylem cells of sycamore trees may
      serve for catalyzing the in vivo synthesis of the xylan main chain during the
      biogenesis of the plant cell wall.

      IN THE PRIMARY CELL WALLS OF SUSPENSION-CULTURED SYCAMORE CELLS.
PG  - 1135-9
AB  - The isolation, purification, and partial characterization of a
      glucuronoarabinoxylan, a previously unobserved component of the primary cell
      walls of dicotyledonous plants, are described. The glucuronoarabinoxylan
      constitutes approximately 5% of the primary walls of suspension-cultured sycamore
      cells. This glucuronoarabinoxylan possesses many of the structural
      characteristics of analogous polysaccharides that have been isolated from the
      primary and secondary cell walls of monocots as well as from the secondary cell
      walls of dicots. The glucuronoarabinoxylan of primary dicot cell walls has a
      linear beta-1,4-linked d-xylopyranosyl backbone with both neutral and acidic
      sidechains attached at intervals along its length. The acidic sidechains are
      terminated with glucuronosyl or 4-O-methyl glucuronosyl residues, whereas the
      neutral sidechains are composed of arabinosyl and/or xylosyl residues.

TI  - Structure of Plant Cell Walls: X. RHAMNOGALACTURONAN I, A STRUCTURALLY COMPLEX
      PECTIC POLYSACCHARIDE IN THE WALLS OF SUSPENSION-CULTURED SYCAMORE CELLS.
PG  - 1128-34
AB  - The purification and characterization of a pectic polymer, rhamnogalacturonan I, 
      present in the primary cell walls of dicots is described. Rhamnogalacturonan I
      accounts for approximately 7% of the mass of the walls isolated from
      suspension-cultured sycamore cells. As purified, rhamnogalacturonan I has a
      molecular weight of approximately 200,000 and is composed primarily of
      l-rhamnosyl, d-galacturonosyl, l-arabinosyl, and d-galactosyl residues. The
      backbone of rhamnogalacturonan I is thought to be composed predominantly of
      d-galacturonosyl and l-rhamnosyl residues in a ratio of approximately 2:1. About 
      half of the l-rhamnosyl residues are 2-linked and are glycosidically attached to 
      C(4) of a d-galacturonosyl residue. The other half of the l-rhamnosyl residues
      are 2,4-linked and have a d-galacturonosyl residue glycosidically attached at
      C(2). Sidechains averaging 6 residues in length are attached to C(4) of the
      l-rhamnosyl residues. There are many different sidechains, containing variously
      linked l-arabinosyl, and/or d-galactosyl residues.

TI  - Dictyosome-endoplasmic reticulum associations in higher plant cells? A
      serial-section analysis.
PG  - 22-36
AB  - Serial sections through permanganate and glutaraldehyde/osmium fixed dictyosomes 
      from suspension cultured sycamore cells and maize root cap cells have been
      analyzed. The results may be summarized as follows. For both sycamore and maize
      dictyosomes are: 1. transition vesicles between ER and dictyosome, and therefore 
      a "forming face" to the dictyosome, not present. 2. direct, tubular ER-cisternal 
      connections doubtful, if at all present; 3. "Maturing faces" to dictyosomes, i.e.
      a polarity in terms of the pinching-off of secretory vesicles, not a typical
      feature; 4. two types of vesicle associated with the dictyosome: large and small 
      (in part "coated"); 5. cisternae present as a flattened, continuous central
      portion at whose periphery an extensive, anastomosing tubule system exists; 6.
      cisternae in the dictyosome stack not concentrically arranged, but lie somewhat
      displaced to one another. A characteristic feature of maize dictyosomes, in
      addition, is a bi- or unilateral distribution of hypertrophied slime vesicles.
      The kidney-shaped slime vesicles are arranged opposite to one another at the
      tubular periphery of a cisternae; the region in between is occupied with smaller,
      occasionally coated, vesicles. It would appear from these results that the
      endomembrane concept sensu strictu [58] is not applicable to higher plant cells
      whose main secretory product is polysaccharide rather than protein. Consequences 
      and alternatives in relation to membrane-flow in such cells are discussed.

      (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) (author's transl)].
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Temperature and oxygen effects on the degree of unsaturation of membrane fatty
      acids have been investigated with sycamore cells in suspension culture. Sycamore 
      cells were incubated with [14C]acetate at temperature varying from 15 to 25
      degrees C and at O2 concentration from 12.5 to 305 muM. It was found that: (i) no
      significant difference was observed in the distribution of radioactivity between 
      oleate and linoleate with different temperatures; (ii) in marked contrast, the
      aeration conditions during growth of plant cell cultures affected the fatty acid 
      pattern of the total lipids: by maintaining the oxygen concentration below 60
      muM, the molar proportion of oleate increased dramatically whereas that of the
      linoleate decreased. Under these conditions, the aeration of the culture medium
      (250 muM) induced a rapid transformation of oleate to linoleate. These results
      cast further doubt on the importance of the temperature on the degree of
      unsaturation of the fatty acids in sycamore cells, but confirmed evidence that
      the formation of unsurated fatty acids by plant cells was indeed controlled by
      the oxygen concentration in solution.

AB  - Cardiolipin and cytochrome aa3 contents of isolated plant cells (sycamore cells) 
      and their purified mitochondria were measured. Since the cardiolipin/cytochrome
      aa3 ratio was the same in the intact cells and in the isolated mitochondria it
      was strongly suggested that cardiolipin is present only in the mitochondria.
      Furthermore, outer and inner mitochondria membranes of purified sycamore cells
      and mung bean hypocotyl mitochondria were separated and it was shown that
      cardiolipin is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

TI  - Abscisic acid, abscisic acid-esters and phaseic acid in vegetative terminal buds 
      of Acer pseudoplatanus during emergence from winter dormancy.
PG  - 591-6
LID - 10.1007/BF00388837 [doi]
AB  - Levels of free-abscisic acid and "boundabscisic acid" (alkaline hydrolyzable
      abscisic acidesters) in replicated samples of terminal vegetative buds of
      sycamore trees were measured during natural emergence from winter dormancy by gas
      chromatographic methods together with isotope dilution estimation of recovery
      rates. Not until after the buds had been released from true dormancy in January
      by winter chilling did any clear change occur in either abscisic acid (ABA)
      fraction, or in total ABA, on any basis of comparison. The percentage of total
      ABA present as the free acid declined at the end of true dormancy to
      approximately two-thirds of its value in the earlier winter months. It is
      concluded that glucosylation of ABA is unlikely to play a major part in the
      mechanism of release from dormancy in vegetative sycamore buds. At the end of
      true dormancy there was a large transient increase in what appeared to be phaseic
      acid, but this was not accompanied by any marked decrease in either free- or
      bound-ABA.

TI  - Studies on the methylation of cytoplasmic ribosomal RNA from cultured higher
      plant cells.
PG  - 203-14
AB  - The methylation of cytoplasmic ribosomal RNA of cultured sycamore cells (Acer
      pseudoplatanus L.) was investigated. Labelled 17-S and 26-S rRNA were prepared
      from cells that had been incubated with either [32P]phosphate, [Me-3H]methionine 
      or [Me-14C]methionine. Ion-exchange resin chromatography of 0.3 M KOH or 1 M HCl 
      hydrolysates and two-dimensional chromatographic analyses of phosphodiesterase
      plus phosphatase digests of 17-S and 26-S rRNA were performed. 17-S and 26-S rRNA
      contain 49 and 91 methyl groups per molecule, respectively. These values were
      verified in sevemral ways. The high degree of methylation of sycamore rRNA,
      particularly for the 26-S rRNA, contrasts with the situation in all other
      investigated organisms. Several methylated bases were identified. 7-Methylguanine
      and 5-methylcytosine both occur in 17-S and 26-S rRNA. N6-Methyladenine and
      N6,N6-dimethyladenine are restricted to the 17-S rRNA while 3-methyluracil and
      1-methyladenine occur in the 26-S rRNA. One hypermodified uridine was also
      tentatively identified in the small rRNA. In 17-S rRNA, there is one copy of
      7-methylguanine, N6-methyladenine and hypermodified uridine and two copies of
      N6,N6-dimethyladenine. 3-Methyluracil, 1-methyladenine and 5-methylcytosine occur
      twice, twice and three times, respectively, in 26-S rRNA. 7-Methylguanine and
      5-methylcytosine are only in submolar amounts in the 26-S and 17-S rRNA,
      respectively. There are 40 +/- 2 and 83 +/- 3 2'-O-methylriboses per 17-S and
      26-S rRNA molecule, respectively. In addition to the four 2'-O-methylnucleosides,
      one 2'-O-methylpseudouridine is present in the 17-S rRNA. Several lines of
      evidence argues for a non-random distribution of the methylriboses. In
      particular, one and seven Nm-Nm-Np structures occur in the 17-S and 26-S rRNA,
      respectively. The data are discussed comparatively with the methylation pattern
      of Escherichia coli, yeast and HeLa cell rRNA.

TI  - Partial base-methylation and other structural differences in the 17 S ribosomal
      RNA of sycamore cells during growth in cell culture.
PG  - 292-301
AB  - Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cytoplasmic rRNA was investigated in rapidly
      dividing cells, cells starting mitosis after the lag phase of growth (4 days)
      induced by deconditioning of the culture medium and also in growth-arrested cells
      from 10 day-old cultures deprived of exogenous auxin (i.e. exponential, early
      exponential and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)-deprived cultures). rRNA
      was extracted and purified from mixed 14C-labelled exponential cultures and
      3H-labelled early exponential cultures. A 14C-labelled exponential culture and a 
      3H-labelled 2,4-D-deprived culture were analyzed in the same way. The 17 S rRNA
      molecules from both early exponential and 2,4-D-deprived cultures displayed a
      lower electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels than those from exponential
      cultures. Alkaline and acid hydrolysates of purified 17 S rRNA labelled on the
      phosphate groups or the methyl groups were analyzed on ion-exchange resins. There
      was no change in the extent of ribose methylation of the molecule from the three 
      different cultures. However, the base methylation of the 17 S rRNA was decreased 
      in early exponential cultures and in 2,4-D-deprived cultures. Part of the
      molecules synthesized in early exponential cultures specifically lacked
      7-methylguanine, N6-methyladenine and N6,N6-dimethyladenine. The possible
      significance of these changes in the 17 S rRNA were discussed.

TI  - Structure of Plant Cell Walls: IX. Purification and Partial Characterization of a
      Wall-degrading Endo-Arabanase and an Arabinosidase from Bacillus subtilis.
PG  - 425-32
AB  - Wild type Bacillus subtilis, when grown on beet araban, secretes into its culture
      medium an endo-arabanase and two arabinosidases. An alternate procedure to one
      previously described (Kaji A, T Saheki 1975 Biochim Biophys Acta 410: 354-360)
      has been developed for the purification of the endo-arabanase. The purified
      endo-arabanase is shown to be homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea disc gel
      electrophoresis (molecular weight approximately 32,000) and by isoelectric
      focusing (pI = 9.3). The endo-arabanase, acting on a branched araban substrate,
      has maximal activity at pH 6.0 and preferentially cleaves 5-linked arabinosyl
      residues. One of the arabinosidases (molecular weight approximately 65,000, pI = 
      5.3) has been purified to the point that it contains only one quantitatively
      minor contaminant, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea disc gel
      electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The purified arabinosidase, acting on
      p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinofuranoside, has maximal activity at pH 6.5, and,
      when acting on a branched araban substrate, preferentially attacks nonreducing
      terminal arabinosyl residues linked to the 2 or 3 position of other arabinosyl
      residues. Neither of the two purified enzymes is capable of hydrolyzing a variety
      of carbohydrate substrates which lack arabinosidic linkages. The purified
      endo-arabinase is shown to be capable of releasing arabinosyl oligomers from the 
      walls of suspension-cultured sycamore cells, thereby suggesting its usefulness as
      a probe in studying the structure of the araban component of primary cell walls.

TI  - Structure of Plant Cell Walls: VIII. A New Pectic Polysaccharide.
PG  - 418-22
AB  - This paper describes the isolation and characterization of rhamnogalacturonan II,
      a hitherto unobserved component of the primary cell walls of dicotyledonous
      plants. Rhamnogalacturonan II constitutes 3 to 4% of the primary cell walls of
      suspension-cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells. Rhamnogalacturonan II
      is a very complex polysaccharide yielding, upon hydrolysis, 10 different
      monosaccharides including the rarely observed sugars apiose, 2-O-methylxylose,
      and 2-O-methylfucose. In addition, rhamnogalacturonan II is characterized by the 
      rarely observed glycosyl interconnections of 2-linked glucuronosyl, 3,4-linked
      fucosyl, and 3-linked rhamnosyl residues. These glycosyl linkages have never
      previously been detected in primary sycamore cell walls. Evidence is presented
      which suggests that polysaccharides similar to rhamnogalacturonan II are present 
      in the primary cell walls of the three other dicotyledonous plants examined.

PG  - 521-4
AB  - Effects of varying levels of phosphorus (P) on sycamore (Platanus occidentalis
      L.) growth and on the endogenous cytokinin levels in the xylem sap were tested.
      The seedlings were grown in aerated nutrient solutions in the greenhouse.
      Photoperiod was held constant at 16 hours. Four P concentrations, 0.02, 0.10,
      0.50, and 2 mm, were used. There were no P deficiency symptoms even at the lowest
      P concentration. The maximum growth occurred in seedlings grown in 0.10 mm P. The
      greatest dry matter yield as well as stem height, stem diameter, and leaf area
      were produced at 0.10 or 0.50 mm P. The amount of cytokinin in xylem sap for each
      harvest during P nutrition followed closely the dry matter values, stem height,
      stem diameter, and leaf area.

AB  - Microsome preparations extracted from wheat roots or sycamore cell suspensions
      catalyzed the transfer of sugar from nucleotide-sugars to endogenous lipidic
      acceptors. The nature of the products biosynthesized from UDP-Glc, GDP-Glc,
      UDP-Gal, UDP-Xyl or UDP-Arab was examined. Sterylglycosides were obtained from
      UDP-Gglc, GDP-Glc or UDP-Xyl. Galactosyldiglycerides were synthesized from
      UDP-Gal. When UDP-Glc or UDP-Gal was used as a substrate, a membrane-bound
      4-epimerase interconverted the epimeric nucleotide-sugars, thereby allowing the
      simultaneous biosynthesis of galactosyldiglycerides and sterylglucosides. The
      biosynthesis of free and acylated sterylglucosides from UDP-Glc, without
      interference of other glycosyl transfer reactions, was obtained by the omission
      of Mg++ ions from the incubation medium. The biosynthesis of
      galactosyldiglycerides from UDP-Gal without interference of other transfer
      reactions was obtained when digitonin was added to the incubation medium of
      sycamore microsomes.

TI  - Mitochondria of Isolated Plant Cells (Acer pseudoplatanus L.): II. Copper
      Deficiency Effects on Cytochrome C Oxidase and Oxygen Uptake.
PG  - 675-9
AB  - The effects of copper deficiency on cell culture growth, cell respiration,
      mitochondrial oxidative properties, and electron transport chain have been
      studied with suspension-cultured sycamore cells (Acer pseudoplatanus L.). Within 
      the range of the copper concentration studied (0.1-25 mug/1 of culture medium),
      the mean rate of cell division is independent of copper concentration. An initial
      copper concentration lower than 2 mug/1 limited the maximum density of population
      reached at the stationary phase of growth.On a protein basis, the uncoupled O(2) 
      uptake rates were about the same for normal and copper-deficient cells. In
      contrast, the half-maximal inhibition of O(2) uptake rate was obtained at greater
      KCN concentration in the normal cells (20 muM) compared to copper-deficient cells
      (2 muM). Similar results were obtained with the normal and copper-deficient
      sycamore cell mitochondria.In the copper-deficient mitochondria, the
      concentration of the cytochrome aa(3) was less than 0.02 nmol/mg mitochondrial
      protein or 1/20 of the normal rate. The b- and c-type cytochrome content was
      invariant with copper depletion. It appeared that cytochrome aa(3) is present in 
      large excess in normal cells. This work also indicated that cytochrome c is a
      very mobile molecule.

TI  - Influence of cations at the plasma membrane in controlling polysaccharide
      secretion from sycamore suspension cells.
PG  - 603-18
AB  - 1. Three soluble polysaccharides and a soluble protein containing hydroxyproline 
      were secreted by sycamore suspension cultures. l-[1-(3)H]Fucose was incorporated 
      solely into the fucose of fucoxyloglucan and l-[1-(14)C]arabinose mainly into the
      arabinose of arabino-galactan. [U-(14)C]Glucose was a general precursor for
      soluble protein and polysaccharides. 2. The steady-state rate of secretion of all
      the polymers was increased within seconds of adding various electrolytes and
      polyelectrolytes to the growth medium. The increased secretion was induced by
      cations at the outer surface of the plasma membrane. It was brought about by a
      stimulation of the normal mechanisms of cell-wall polysaccharide secretion. It
      was partly inhibited by anaerobiosis or sodium arsenate and was unaffected by
      temperature changes in the range 0-35 degrees C. 3. The precursor pool from which
      secretion was induced contained completely synthesized polysaccharides and was
      probably located in the Golgi-derived vesicles. The results indicated that the
      endoplasmic reticulum did not secrete polysaccharide directly to the cell
      exterior. 4. The various cations probably induced secretion by causing a
      depolarization of the negative electric potential of the cell surface, and this
      resulted in the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane. 5. Analogy with
      exocytosis and pinocytosis in various animal tissues suggested that the decreased
      surface potential brought about membrane fusion by causing an increase in
      plasma-membrane permeability to Ca(2+). 6. The results showed that the fusion of 
      vesicles with the plasma membrane was rate-limiting and a potential control
      point. Auxin-stimulated cell-wall deposition could be a result of a stimulated
      influx of Ca(2+) causing vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane.

AB  - A polysaccharide, isolated from rapeseed hulls by extraction with aqueous sodium 
      hydroxide-sodium tetraborate, contained residues of L-arabinose, L-fucose,
      D-xylose, D-galactose, and D-glucose in the proportions of 2:8:25:13:52.
      Acetolysis furnished cellobiose, 6-O-alpha-D-xylopyranosyl-D-glucose, and
      2-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl D-xylose. The cleavage products from the methylated
      polysaccharide were examined by g.l.c. of the methyl glycosides and g.l.c.-mass
      spectrometry of the partially methylated, alditol acetates. The results show that
      the polysaccharide is a member of the xyloglucan group in which additional fucose
      and galactose residues terminate some of the side-chains. For comparative
      purposes, aspects of the structures of xyloglucans from nasturtium seeds and
      suspension-cultured sycamore cells have been re-examined.

PG  - 267-79
AB  - During the transition from primary wall formation to secondary thickening there
      is a marked shift in the synthesis of pectin, hemicellulose and cellulose. The
      activities of the enzymes [UDP-D-galactose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2)8
      UDP-l-arabinose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.5), UDP-D-glucose dehydrogenase (EC
      1.1.1.22) and UDP-D--glucuronate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.35)] were measured in
      cambial cells, differentiating xylem cells and differentiated xylem cells
      isolated from sycamore and poplar trees, and phloem cells from poplar. At the
      final stage of the differentiation of cambium to xylem there was a decrease in
      activity of the enzymes directly involved in producing the soluble precursors of 
      pectin (DUP-D-galactose 4-epimerase and UDP-L-arabinose 4-epimerase and an
      increase in those producing the precursors of hemicellulose (UDP-D-glucose
      dehydrogenase and UDP-D-glucuronate decarboxylase). These results strongly
      suggest ahat the changes were correlated with the differences observed in the
      chemical composition of the wall during development. The changes found in the
      catalytic activity of the enzymes of nucleoside diphosphate sugar interconversion
      exert a coarse control over the synthesis of pectin and hemicelluloses. The
      tissues at all stages of development contained the necessary enzyme activities to
      produce all the precursors of pectin and hemicellulose, even at the final stage
      of differentiation when no pectin was formed.

AB  - In sycamore cells grown on nitrate as opposed to glutamate there is a higher
      pentose phosphate pathway carbon flux relative to glycolysis in the early stages 
      of cell growth when nitrate assimilation is most active. The high pentose
      phosphate pathway activity compared with glycolysis in nitrate grown cells is
      accompanied by enhanced levels of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase,
      glucose-6-phosphate de-hydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and
      transketolase. There is no significant increase in activity of the solely
      glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase. It is suggested that the increased
      pentose phosphate pathway activity in nitrate grown cells is correlated with a
      demand by nitrite assimilation for NADPH.

AB  - Wild type Bacillus subtilis, when grown on a soybean arabinan-galactan, secretes 
      a beta-1,4-galactanase which has been purified more than 200-fold from the
      culture fluid. Affinity chromatography was the most effective step in a
      purification procedure which resulted in a preparation that contained only a
      single 40,000 molecular weight protein band upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-disc gel 
      electrophoresis. The purified galactanase digests a beta-1,4-galactan purified
      from citrus pectin and digests partially the isolated cell walls of
      suspension-cultured sycamore cells. The predominant product of the enzymic
      degradation of the substrates tested is a 4-linked tetragalactose. Evidence is
      presented to support the hypothesis that the galactanase attacks its substrates
      in both an exo- and endo-manner. The products obtained upon galactanase digestion
      of the soybean arabianin-galactan demonstrate that the earlier proposal
      concerning the structure of this polysaccharide must be incorrect.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (optimum concentration c. 1.0%) is essential to the initiation of 
      the growth in suspension culture or on agar plates of cultured sycamore cells. By
      effective flushing of the cultures with CO2 -free air it is possible to
      demonstrate this requirement with initial cell densities up to 50 x 10(3) cells
      ml(-1) . This growth-promoting activity of carbon dioxide is not related to any
      effect it may have on the pH of the culture medium. The cells fix applied carbon 
      dioxide into organic and amino acids but attempts to replace the carbon dioxide
      requirement by non-toxic levels of organic or amino acids have not been
      successful.

TI  - Atmospheric pollen counts in Tehran, Iran, 1974.
PG  - 344-51
AB  - Daily pollen counts were made in Tehran by placing a Durham sampler on the roof
      of the College of Pharmacy building at the University of Tehran. Three pollen
      seasons were identified in Tehran. Tree season extended from the first week of
      February through the middle of October. Important pollens of tree season were
      Willow, Cedar, Sycamore, Pine, Alder, Walnuts, Elm, Cottonwood, Oak and/or Maple,
      Birch, and Beech. The grass season started from the first week of May and
      extended into the second week of November. The weed season began at the middle of
      May and lasted until the last week of December. Important weed pollens belonged
      to various members of the Order Chenopodials, particularly Burning Bush, and
      Russian Thistle. Sagebrush and English Plantain were also abundant during the
      weed season.

TI  - Subcellular distribution and properties of poly(A)-containing RNA from cultured
      plant cells.
PG  - 599-606
AB  - Cultured sycamore cells rapidly incorporate [3H]uridine or [32P]orthophosphate
      into rRNA precursors and polydisperse RNA. Mature rRNA accumulates only after a
      lag period of approximately 40 min. Fractionation of pulse-labelled cells and
      analysis of the RNA shows that after 30 min the rRNA precursors, together with
      some polydisperse RNA, are confined to the nucleus. In consequence radioactive
      polydisperse RNA can be isolated from polyribosomes in the complete absence of
      labelled rRNA. Approximately 40% of this RNA is retained by an
      oligo(dT)-cellulose column and by this criterion is judged to contain poly(A)
      sequences. A smaller proportion of nuclear polydisperse RNA also contains
      poly(A). The tendency for poly(A)-containing RNA to aggregate complicates
      molecular weight determinations. Denaturation of poly(A)-containing RNA in 8 M
      urea prior to gel electrophoresis produces a broad peak of RNA with an average Mr
      = 10(6). Analysis of the nucleotide composition of total cell poly(A)-containing 
      RNA shows that it contains 41% AMP. Roughly 6% of this RNA is resistant to
      digestion by ribonuclease A and T1. AMP is the only nucleotide detectable in
      these fragments. From their mobility during electrophoresis in 8 M urea at 60
      degrees C with 5.8-S, 5-S and tRNA as molecular weight markers it is concluded
      that the poly(A) regions contain an average of 160 nucleotides.

TI  - Ribosomal cistrons in higher plant cells. II. Sequence homology between the two
      mature rRNAs of sycamore cells and intracistronic reiteration. A DNA - rRNA
      hybridization study.
PG  - 117-31
AB  - 1. Uniformly labelled rRNA of sycamore cells has been annealed with homologous
      DNA. The fractions of DNA complementary to the 17S, or 26S, or 17S + 26S rRNAs
      are found to be 0.19%, 0.15% and 0.23%. They are not in the ratio of the
      molecular weight values (0.8, 1.2 and 2 - 10(6), respectively for the 17S, 26S
      and 17S + 26S rRNAs). This result is compatible with the large hybridization
      competition observed between the two rRNAs (53 and 72%) and with the shift-down
      of saturation curves when DNA is presaturated with unlabelled rRNA before the
      incubation with the other labelled rRNA. 2. Under the selected experimental
      procedure, the DNA - rRNA hybrids formed appear to be specific. Since there is an
      equal number of structural genes for the 17S and 26S rRNAs, these results mean
      the occurrence of a great sequence homology, strictly restricted to the two
      rRNAs. Homologous and specific sequences have been estimated to 0.1 and 0.7, or
      0.85 and 0.35 million daltons, respectively in the 17S or 26S structural genes.
      3. From the calculated lengths of homologous sequences, an intracistronic
      reiteration of some ribosomal sequences can be deduced. This internal reiteration
      is directly evidenced by the complex pattern of DNA - rRNA annealing curves. As
      demonstrated by base-composition analysis, the internal reiteration is
      heterogeneous and concerns both the homologous and specific sequences. In
      addition, the DNA saturation values allow the calculation of 4000 copies for the 
      ribosomal cistron in the whole sycamore genome.

TI  - Ribosomal cistrons in higher plant cells. I. A definitive scheme for the
      maturation pathway of the primary transcriptional product of ribosomal cistrons
      in Acer pseudoplatanus L. cells.
PG  - 104-16
AB  - 1. Four precursor ribosomal RNAs have been previously characterized in cultured
      sycamore cells (Acer pseudoplatanus L.). The present paper reports a study of the
      two smallest ones. 2. (Me-3H)-labelling of the precursor and mature rRNAs has
      been submitted to kinetic analysis. From pulse-chase experiments it is concluded 
      that the 27S and 20S precursor rRNAs behave like intermediate molecules in the
      maturation of the 42S and 36S precursor rRNAs into the 26S and 17S components.
      They are direct precursors to the cytoplasmic and mature rRNAs. 3.
      Base-composition analyses have been performed on carefully purified molecules.
      They show that the 27S and 20S precursor rRNAs arise from a single cleavage of
      the 36S precursor rRNA. In addition, they strongly suggest that the 27S and 20S
      precursor rRNAs can be taken as specific precursors to the 26S and 17S rRNAs,
      respectively. These results are reinforced by DNA - RNA hybridization
      experiments, the measured values being in good agreement with the theoretical
      ones expected from a specific relationship between the four smallest molecules.
      Base-compositions of the conserved and non-conserved nucleotide sequences of the 
      primary transcriptional product have been estimated or calculated. 4. On the
      basis of the present results and those previously reported, a scheme for the
      biosynthesis of ribosomal RNA in sycamore cells is proposed.

PG  - 125-9
LID - 10.1007/BF00388893 [doi]
AB  - The effect of the nature and concentration of the nitrogen source on respiratory 
      activity and removal of carbohydrate from the medium in suspension cultured
      sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells was determined. Comparison was also made 
      of the rates of uptake of the two alternative nitrogen sources, nitrate and
      glutamate, at differing initial nitrogen concentrations within the range 7-14 mM.
      The initial pH of the culture medium before inoculation was 5.2; after
      inoculation the pH of both nitrate and glutamate cultures rose to reach an
      eventual level in the range 7.0-7.1. Glutamate was removed from the medium more
      slowly than nitrate. Under the particular conditions of culture used the growth
      of the cells was nitrogen limited. Sugar uptake from the medium continued for
      some time after the nitrogen in the medium was depleted. The data show that
      although cell division and protein content are nitrogen-limited, dry weight and
      fresh weight yields may also be determined in a complex interaction through
      carbohydrate availability. There were no obvious differences in respiratory
      activity between cultures grown on nitrate or glutamate.

LID - 10.1007/BF00388892 [doi]
AB  - Suspension cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells will grow with either
      nitrate or glutamate as sole nitrogen source. Under the particular culture
      conditions used, cell growth is nitrogen limited. Within the range of initial
      nitrogen concentrations used (7-14 mM), cell growth on nitrate or glutamate at
      the same initial nitrogen concentrations is generally comparable. The rate of
      cell growth on these two nitrogen sources is also comparable with that observed
      when urea or urea plus nitrate is the prime nitrogen source. Increased nitrogen
      concentrations result in proportional increases in the final yield of numbers of 
      cells, soluble protein and fresh weight. Dry weight yield by contrast shows both 
      an absolute and relative decline with increasing nitrogen concentrations. At
      higher initial nitrogen concentrations differences are apparent in the pattern of
      cell growth between nitrate and glutamate grown cells.

AB  - The cytokinins present in the spring sap of Acer pseudoplatanus L. were
      investigated. Ribosyl-trans-zeatin, trans-zeatin and dihydrozeatin were isolated 
      and identified by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A number
      of other cytokinin active fractions were observed. One of these was less polar
      than zeatin and did not behave as any known cytokinin. Two other fractions were
      more polar than ribosylzeatin and were unstable. A decomposition product of one
      of these was identified as ribosyl-trans-zeatin by GC-MS. The possible nature of 
      the unstable compounds is discussed. Data on the changes in cytokinin activity of
      the various fractions during spring 1973 are presented and discussed.

TI  - Biosynthesis of mannan and mannolipids from GDP-Man by membrane fractions of
      sycamore cell cultures.
PG  - 1195-211
AB  - Membrane fractions have been prepared from sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cell
      suspensions grown in liquid medium. These fractions catalyzed the transfer of
      mannoxyl-units from GDP-(14C) Man into a polymannoside, a mannolipid and
      oligosaccharide-lipids. The polymannoside was partially solubilized by
      proteolytic digestion or maceration in sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea mixtures.
      However no evidence is available of a covalent linkage between the biosynthesized
      glycan and peptides. The structural analysis of the (14C)mannan showed that the
      polysaccharide was a homopolymer of beta-(1 leads to 4) linked mannose with a few
      branches. During the incubation of the membranes with the substrate, the polymer 
      chains elongated with a large number of sugar units and contained 25 to 40 hexose
      residues per non-reducing end monomer. GDP-Glc was a competitive inhibitor of the
      GDP-Man: beta-mannan mannosyl-transferase, whereas GDP-Man activated a GDP-Gle:
      beta-glucan glucosyl-transferase present in the same membrane preparation. Two
      kinds of glycolipids were synthesized in the presence of GDP-(14C)Man. The first 
      (I) contained a polar moiety characterized as a mannose-phosphate and was very
      similar to polyprenyl-phosphate-mannose identified in plants by Alam and Hemming.
      The other mannolipid (II) was hydrolyzed by mild acid into labeled
      oligosaccharides of high molecular weight. This material was separated into two
      oligosaccharide fractions, the first (II A) of MW over 5000, the second (II B) of
      MW around 1700. II B contained at most two labeled mannose residues per chain,
      linked to the non-reducing end of unlabeled units which probably contained
      neutral sugars and N-acetyl-osamine(s) near the reducing end. Oligosaccharide II 
      A seemed to contain one or several II B chains.

PG  - 113-9
AB  - A population skin-tested with pollen from twelve wind pollinated tree species
      showed a variable level of allergenicity, particularly among adults. Pollen
      extracts of Box Elder, Willow and Hickory elicited the highest allergic
      reactions, Oak, Birch, Sycamore, Black Walnut and Poplar more moderate reactions,
      while allergens from Cottonwood, Maple, Elm and White Ash were less reactive.
      Since Box Elder is ubiquitous and produces a strongly positive reaction among
      adults, it should be included among skin tests of those patients known to be
      allergic to early spring pollen.

TI  - Kinetic aspects of synchrony in suspension cultures of Acer pseudoplatanus L.
PG  - 337-48
AB  - Synchronous divisions have been induced in cell suspension cultures of sycamore
      (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) initiated at low density from stationary phase,
      nitrate-starved cells. The pattern of division and DNA replication synchrony is
      unusual in that it does not show progressive decay but rather a sharp transition 
      to asynchrony. Feulgen densitometry data indicate that in terms of an S-phase
      synchrony index, DNA replication becomes more highly synchronized as cell density
      rises and interphase duration is reduced. In comparison with asynchronous
      cultures the duration of mitosis appears to be reduced during synchronous growth.
      The persistence of division and S-phase synchrony and the apparent shortening of 
      interphase and mitosis in these sycamore cultures suggests the operation of
      intercellular entrainment. The departure from synchrony during the interphase
      which precedes initiation of asynchronous division remains unexplained.

AB  - Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) calluses resistant to azaguanine were isolated 
      after mutagenesis with nitrosoguanidine. One callus SNC61 was highly variable in 
      its growth on 10 mug/ml azaguanine and it was concluded that its resistance was
      not due to a stable alteration in the callus. Another callus SNE31 was isolated
      after 4.5 months culture in 0.5 or 1 mug/ml azaguanine which had a 10-fold
      increase in resistance to azaguanine. This was shown to be accompanied by a
      reduction to 50% of the normal level of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
      (E.C.2.4.2.8).

TI  - Survival of Suspension-cultured Sycamore Cells Cooled to the Temperature of

PG  - 722-4
AB  - Suspension-cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) which were
      immersed in liquid nitrogen after prefreezing to the temperatures from -30 to -50
      C in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide and glucose as cryoprotective additive
      could proliferate vigorously when rewarmed rapidly in water at 40 C. For
      maintaining high viability of the cells after immersion in liquid nitrogen, it
      seems to be essential to use the cells at the later lag phase or the early cell
      division phase. This study provides a possibility for long term preservation in
      liquid nitrogen of plant-cultured lines.

TI  - The relationship of root-cap slimes to pectins.
PG  - 525-34
AB  - 1. The patterns of incorporation of radioactivity from d-[U-(14)C]glucose into
      the pectic components of sections of sycamore roots changed so that sections
      nearer the tip incorporated relatively more label into arabinose and galactose
      compared with uronic acid. 2. Radioactive maize root-cap slime was prepared and
      found to contain three water-soluble component polymers which were
      electrophoretically (i) neutral, (ii) weakly acidic and (iii) strongly acidic at 
      pH6.5. The neutral component was a glucan. The other components, which could be
      degraded by trans-elimination, consisted of an acidic backbone chain composed of 
      galacturonic acid and glucose, attached to which were different proportions of
      neutral sugars. Arabinose, galactose and fucose, the main neutral sugars of the
      weakly and strongly acidic materials, were absent from the neutral fraction. 3.
      Fucose was a major sugar in maize-root slime and in a slime of similar
      composition synthesized by a maize callus of shoot origin. Only trace amounts
      were found in sycamore, pea and wheat root tips, and in pectin prepared from
      maize roots and coleoptiles. A high proportion of fucose is therefore a chemical 
      characteristic of maize slime, and slime synthesis indicated a state of
      differentiation of the tissue. 4. The similarity between the slime and pectin is 
      discussed; slime is a form of pectin modified in such a way as to provide a
      hydrated protective coating around the root tip.

      perenne), and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris cultivars Red Kidney and Small White)
      suspension-cultured cells has been detected and partially characterized. The H(+)
      efflux has been shown to require a source of energy, to be significantly
      stimulated by Na(+) and Mg(2+) but not by K(+) and Ca(2+), and to have a pH
      optimum at 7. The study of this H(+) efflux was undertaken because the
      characteristics of auxin-induced growth and of H(+)-induced growth are
      sufficiently similar to suggest that a H(+) efflux may be an intermediate in the 
      mechanism of auxin-induced growth. However, the H(+) efflux from these
      suspension-cultured cells was found to be insensitive to exogenously added
      hormones.

PG  - 327-9
AB  - Degradation of the sycamore cell wall by hydrazinolysis yielded soluble
      glycopeptides. The peptide portion of the predominant glycopeptide was shown to
      be cyclic (4-trans-hydroxy-l-prolyl)-4-trans-hydroxy- l-proline. From this
      structure and the composition of the major glycopeptide it was deduced that only 
      short oligosaccharides are attached to the hydroxyprolyl residues of the wall
      glycoprotein. Detailed evidence for the structure of the peptide is given in a

PG  - 205-210
LID - 10.1007/BF00360511 [doi]
AB  - Both sycamore and lime aphids live on the leaves of their respective host trees. 
      The sycamore aphid unlike the lime aphid has the ability to adapt metabolically
      to changes in temperature. The difference in ability of these two tree-dwelling
      aphids to adapt metabolically to changes in temperature can be related to their
      mode of life. The sycamore aphid lives on sycamore which is native to the
      mountainous areas of southern and central Europe where conditions are cool.
      Sycamore also has a longer growth period than lime as its buds burst earlier and 
      it sheds its leaves later. Sycamore aphids are therefore naturally exposed to a
      wider range of temperatures than lime aphids.

TI  - The Structure of Plant Cell Walls: IV. A Structural Comparison of the Wall
      Hemicellulose of Cell Suspension Cultures of Sycamore (Acer PseudoPlatAnus) and
      of Red Kidney Bean (Phaseolus Vulgaris).
PG  - 889-93
AB  - The molecular structure and chemical properties of the hemicellulose present in
      the isolated cell walls of suspension cultures of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) 
      cells has recently been described by Bauer et al. (Plant Physiol. 51: 174-187).
      The hemicellulose of the sycamore primary cell wall is a xyloglucan. This polymer
      functions as an important cross-link in the structure of the cell wall; the
      xyloglucan is hydrogen-bonded to cellulose and covalently attached to the pectic 
      polymers.The present paper describes the structure of a xyloglucan present in the
      walls and in the extracellular medium of suspension-cultured Red Kidney bean
      (Phaseolus vulgaris) cells and compares the structure of the bean xyloglucan with
      the structure of the sycamore xyloglucan. Although some minor differences were
      found, the basic structure of the xyloglucans in the cell walls of these
      distantly related species is the same. The structure is based on a repeating
      heptasaccharide unit which consists of four residues of beta-1, 4-linked glucose 
      and three residues of terminal xylose linked to the 6 position of three of the
      glucosyl residues.

PG  - 188-97
AB  - Degradative enzymes have been used to obtain defined fragments of the isolated
      cell walls of suspension-cultured sycamore cells. These fragments have been
      purified and structurally characterized. Fragments released from
      endopolygalacturonase-pretreated cell walls by a purified endoglucanase and the
      fragments extracted from these walls by urea and alkali provide evidence for a
      covalent connection between the xyloglucan and pectic polysaccharides. Fragments 
      released by a protease from endopolygalacturonase-endoglucanase-pretreated cell
      walls provide evidence for a covalent connection between the pectic
      polysaccharides and the structural protein of the cell wall. Based on these
      interconnections and the strong binding which occurs between the xyloglucan and
      cellulose, a tentative structure of the cell wall is proposed.

AB  - The molecular structure, chemical properties, and biological function of the
      xyloglucan polysaccharide isolated from cell walls of suspension-cultured
      sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells are described. The sycamore wall xyloglucan 
      is compared to the extracellular xyloglucan secreted by suspension-cultured
      sycamore cells into their culture medium and is also compared to the seed
      "amyloid" xyloglucans.Xyloglucan-or fragments of xyloglucan-and acidic fragments 
      of the pectic polysaccharides are released from endopolygalacturonase-pretreated 
      sycamore walls by treatment of these walls with 8 m urea, endoglucanase, or 0.5 n
      NaOH. Some of the xyloglucan thus released is found to cochromatograph with the
      acidic pectic fragments on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex. The chemical or enzymic
      treatments required for the release of xyloglucan from the walls and the
      cochromatography of xyloglucan with the acidic pectic fragments indicate that
      xyloglucan is covalently linked to the pectic polysaccharides and is
      noncovalently bound to the cellulose fibrils of the sycamore cell wall.The
      molecular structure of sycamore xyloglucan was characterized by methylation
      analysis of the oligosaccharides obtained by endoglucanase treatment of the
      polymer. The structure of the polymer is based on a repeating heptasaccharide
      unit which consists of 4 residues of beta-1-4-linked glucose and 3 residues of
      terminal xylose. A single xylose residue is glycosidically linked to carbon 6 of 
      3 of the glucosyl residues.

TI  - The Structure of Plant Cell Walls: I. The Macromolecular Components of the Walls 
      of Suspension-cultured Sycamore Cells with a Detailed Analysis of the Pectic
      Polysaccharides.
PG  - 158-73
AB  - This is the first in a series of papers dealing with the structure of cell walls 
      isolated from suspension-cultured sycamore cells (Acer pseudoplatanus). These
      studies have been made possible by the availability of purified hydrolytic
      enzymes and by recent improvements in the techniques of methylation analysis.
      These techniques have permitted us to identify and quantitate the macromolecular 
      components of sycamore cell walls. These walls are composed of 10% arabinan, 2%
      3,6-linked arabinogalactan, 23% cellulose, 9% oligo-arabinosides (attached to
      hydroxyproline), 8% 4-linked galactan, 10% hydroxyproline-rich protein, 16%
      rhamnogalacturonan, and 21% xyloglucan.The structures of the pectic polymers (the
      neutral arabinan, the neutral galactan, and the acidic rhamnogalacturonan) were
      obtained, in part, by methylation analysis of fragments of these polymers which
      were released from the sycamore walls by the action of a highly purified
      endopolygalacturonase. The data suggest a branched arabinan and a linear 4-linked
      galactan occurring as side chains on the rhamnogalacturonan. Small amounts or
      pieces of a xyloglucan, the wall hemicellulose, appear to be covalently linked to
      some of the galactan chains. Thus, the galactan appears to serve as a bridge
      between the xyloglucan and rhamnogalacturonan components of the wall.The
      rhamnogalacturonan consists of an alpha-(1 --> 4)-linked galacturonan chain which
      is interspersed with 2-linked rhamnosyl residues. The rhamnosyl residues are not 
      randomly distributed in the chain but probably occur in units of rhamnosyl- (1
      --> 4)-galacturonosyl- (1 --> 2)-rhamnosyl. This sequence appears to alternate
      with a homogalacturonan sequence containing approximately 8 residues of 4-linked 
      galacturonic acid. About half of the rhamnosyl residues are branched, having a
      substituent attached to carbon 4. This is likely to be the site of attachment of 
      the 4-linked galactan.The hydroxyprolyl oligo-arabinosides of the
      hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein contain 3-linked, 2-linked, and terminal
      arabinosyl residues. The structure of the hydroxyprolyl oligo-arabinosides
      deduced from our methylation studies agrees with the structure reported for
      similar oligosaccharides.

AB  - Extracts of sycamore cambial tissue convert UDP-glucose into UDP-glucuronic acid,

      galactose series of monosaccharides was formed indicating the absence of

      formed in greater quantities than any of its nucleoside analogues and it is
      suggested that UDP-glucose plays a more important role in carbohydrate metabolism
      in this tissue.

AB  - Enzymes which catalyze the glycosylation of the cell wall protein extensin using 
      uridine diphosphate l-arabinose-(14)C as a substrate are present in a crude
      extract prepared from suspension cultured sycamore cells (Acer pseudoplatanus
      L.). This enzyme system sediments when the crude extract is subjected to
      centrifugation at 37000g. A base hydrolysate of the product contains a mixture of
      hydroxyproline-arabinosides which are electrophoretically and chromatographically
      identical to those obtained by hydrolysis of extensin isolated from the cell
      wall. The hydroxyproline-rich protein used as an acceptor in the glycosylation
      reactions is present in the particulate fraction. In addition, evidence is
      presented which indicates that hydroxyproline-rich tryptic peptides prepared from
      the cell wall can also be used as an acceptor by this enzyme system. The presence
      of Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) in the reaction mixture increases the enzyme-catalyzed
      incorporation of arabinose into extensin by about 1.4 times. About two-thirds of 
      the product mixture is composed of arabinose-containing compounds which have not 
      been identified. Some of these products appear to be hydroxyproline-glycosides
      which have not been previously reported.

      pseudoplatanus (L.).
PG  - 134-45
LID - 10.1007/BF00386990 [doi]
AB  - Dormancy of intact sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) seeds was broken by chilling (5
      degrees C) for several weeks in moist conditions. Treatment of unchilled seeds
      with kinetin induced some germination, but gibberellin was ineffective. This
      stimulation by kinetin was not suppressed by the added presence of abscisic acid 
      during incubation.The chilling requirement of intact seeds was eliminated by
      removal of the testa, and the naked embryos developed with no morphological
      abnormalities. During early growth of isolated embryos in the light, two distinct
      developmental processes were recognised. One involved initial elongation of the
      radicle accompanied by geotropic curvature and was stimulated by kinetin but not 
      by gibberellin, while the other involved unrolling of the cotyledons, which was
      accelerated by gibberellin but much less by kinetin. Abscisic acid strongly
      suppressed both developmental processes when applied alone, inhibited cotyledon
      expansion in the presence of gibberellin, but failed to overcome the promotory
      effects of kinetin on radicle growth. Experiments with CCC indicated that under
      natural conditions the unrolling of the cotyledons is dependent upon endogenous
      gibberellin. Radicle growth of isolated embryos was unimpaired by incubation in
      the dark, but cotyledon expansion of water incubated embryos was poor, and
      although it was accelerated by gibberellin, the responses in all treatments were 
      slower than in the corresponding light grown samples.It is suggested that
      endogenous cytokinins are primary factors in the initiation of radicle growth,
      while gibberellins are important in cotyledon expansion. Abscisic acid appears to
      have an inhibitory role in both processes, and the interactions of these
      regulators in the control of germination and development are discussed.

LID - 10.1007/BF00386988 [doi]
AB  - Dormant seeds of Acer pseudoplatanus L. contain two zones of inhibition on paper 
      chromatograms in "10:1:1" as detected by the lettuce and cress seed germination, 
      and the wheat coleoptile bioassays. One zone at Rf 0.6-0.8 was partitioned into
      ethyl acetate at acid pH and was shown to contain ABA by its behaviour on GLC and
      isomerization under ultra-violet light. The other zone at Rf 0.9 was detected
      only in the germination bioassays and was partitioned into ethyl acetate over a
      range of pH indicating the presence of one or more neutral compounds.The
      inhibitors present in the embryo of dormant sycamore seeds inhibited the
      germination of non-dormant sycamore seeds at relatively low concentrations. A
      comparison with the effects of application of exogenous ABA indicated that
      endogenous ABA could not solely account for the inhibitory activity of seed
      extracts, which appeared to be due partly to the presence of ABA and partly to
      that of neutral compounds present in the embryo. Leaching treatments that removed
      dormancy led to a decrease in the level of inhibitors present mainly in the basic
      fraction. The exogenous application of kinetin to dormant sycamore seeds
      increased germination whereas gibberellic acid had no effect. Similar responses
      were obtained with lettuce seeds inhibited by the basic fraction of dormant
      sycamore seeds.It is suggested that an inhibitor-cytokinin interaction may be
      involved in the dormancy of sycamore seeds.

AB  - The activity of UDPGlc: NAD oxidoreductase is measured in enzyme preparations
      obtained from sycamore cambium and xylem tissue. The activity of this enzyme is
      greater in xylem than in cambium whether expressed on a specific activity basis
      or on a per-cell basis. It is suggested that, in developing xylem, direct
      oxidation of UDPGlc may contribute significantly to the biosynthesis of
      polysaccharide precursors.

TI  - Powers of representations of the rotation group (their symmetric, alternating,
      and other parts).
PG  - 1181-4
AB  - It has been known for more than three quarters of a century that the square of
      the irreducible representation D(j), of dimension 2j + 1, of the 3-dimensional
      rotation group R(3) contains the representations D(2j),D(2j - 1),...,D(1),D(0) of
      R(3), each occurring once. I give in this paper a method, involving no more than 
      the expansion of (1 + x +... + x(2j))(n-1), of analyzing (D(j))(n), the nth power
      of D(j), n = 3, 4, 5,..., into the sum of the irreducible representations D(nj), 
      D(nj - 1),..., D(1), D(0) of R(3), each occurring a stated number of times. When 
      n = 2, the part D(2j) + D(2j - 2) +... + D(2) + D(0) of (D(j))(2) is associated
      with the partition (2) of 2 and is termed the symmetric part of (D(j))(2), while 
      the remaining part, D(2j - 1) + D(2j - 3) +... + D(3) + D(1), of (D(j))(2) is
      associated with the partition (1(2)) of 2 and is termed the alternating part of
      (D(j))(2). For any value of n, (D(j))(n) contains various parts, each associated 
      with a k-part partition of n, where k </= 2j + 1, the part associated with the
      l-part partition (n) of n being termed the symmetric part of (D(j))(n) and the
      part associated with the n-part partition (1(n)) of n, where n </= 2j + 1, being 
      termed the alternating part of (D(j))(n). If n > 2j + 1, (D(j))(n) has no
      alternating part. I show how to determine these various parts giving full details
      when j = 1 and n is arbitary, and when j is arbitrary and n = 3 or 4. I also show
      that when n = 2m + 1 is odd the alternating part of (D(j))(n) is, when it exists,
      i.e., when m </= j, the same as the symmetric part of (D(j - m))(n) and that the 
      alternating part of (D(j))(n) is the same as the alternating part of (D(j))(n'), 
      where n + n' = 2j + 1. This implies that, when n is even and <2j + 1, the
      alternating part of (D(j))(n) is the same as the symmetric part of
      (D(n/2))(2j+1-n).

TI  - Hydroxyproline: Observations on its chemical and autoradiographical localization 
      in plant cell wall protein.
PG  - 43-51
LID - 10.1007/BF00398013 [doi]
AB  - In sycamore suspension cells both autoradiographical and chemical techniques have
      confirmed the idea that most of the protein that contains hydroxyproline is
      located within the cell wall. Relatively more hydroxyproline is incorporated into
      the walls of stationary phase cells than into those of cells actively engaged in 
      cell division. It is probable that the protein enters the wall during and after
      the later stages of cell plate consolidation, and this may be facilitated by
      means of smooth membrane. Distinctive and heavy incorporation of radioactive
      proline is found associated with unusual wall thickenings or 'warts'.

TI  - A Cell Wall-degrading Endopolygalacturonase Secreted by Colletotrichum
      lindemuthianum.
PG  - 293-8
AB  - Cultures of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (Saccardo and Magnus) Scribner have
      been induced to secrete an endopolygalacturonase (polygalacturonide
      glycanohydrolase EC3.2. 1.15). This enzyme has been brought to a high state of
      purity by ion exchange, gel filtration, and agarose affinity chromatography. The 
      enzyme has optimal activity at pH 5, has an apparent molecular weight as
      determined by gel filtration of about 70,000, and prefers polygalacturonic acid
      to pectin as its substrate. The enzyme, while hydrolyzing only 1% of the
      glycosidic bonds, reduces the viscosity of a polygalacturonic solution by 50%.
      Nevertheless, the initial as well as the final products of polygalacturonic acid 
      hydrolysis are predominantly tri- and digalacturonic acid and, to a lesser
      extent, monogalacturonic acid. The purified enzyme catalyzes the removal of about
      80% of the galacturonic acid residues of cell walls isolated from
      suspension-cultured sycamore cells (Acer pseudoplatanus) as well as from the
      walls isolated from 8-day-old Red Kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) hypocotyls.

TI  - Airey's Converging Factor.
PG  - 440-1
AB  - Asmptotic series for the calculation of functions, for values of the argument
      numerically >1, start off with terms whose numerical values decrease but, at a
      certain stage, the terms begin to increase in numerical value and must be
      ignored. At this stage, there may be two adjacent terms of equal numerical value;
      when the least term of the asymptotic series is spoken of, it is in reference to 
      the first of these two terms. The sum of the initial terms of the asymptotic
      series up to, and including, the least term often furnishes a fair approximation 
      to the desired value of the function being evaluated. It was early observed by
      computers that if the terms of the asymptotic series alternate in sign, this
      approximation was often improved by replacing the least term by its half. The
      factor by which the least term of the asymptotic series must be multiplied so
      that the true value of the function being evaluated is obtained by addition of
      this modified least term to the remaining initial terms of the asymptotic series 
      is known as the converging factor for the asymptotic series. The converging
      factor for the asymptotic series involved in the calculation of the exponential
      integral, for large negative values of the argument, was given as a power series 
      in the reciprocal of the argument by Airey; the first term of this series is
      (1/2). A method for the determination of the coefficients of this series is
      given.

TI  - The formation of glycoproteins in tissues of higher plants. Specific labelling
      with D-(1- 14 C)glucosamine.
PG  - 999-1008
AB  - 1. Radioactivity from d-[l-(14)C]glucosamine is incorporated into
      ethanol-insoluble compounds of high molecular weight in a number of plant
      tissues, including roots of corn (Zea mays), callus cells of sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus), axenic cultures of duckweed (Lemna minor) and germinating
      seedlings of corn, broad bean (Vicia faba) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). 2.
      Except in the case of Lemna, where some of the radioactivity was recovered in
      glucose, hydrolysis of these ethanol-insoluble materials with acid released
      [(14)C]glucosamine as the major radioactive product. 3. The labelled compounds
      isolated from Zea roots and the Acer cells are believed to be glycoproteins
      rather than polysaccharides on the basis of their solubility properties, their
      charge characteristics and their susceptibility to hydrolysis by 0.5m-potassium
      hydroxide and by the proteases trypsin and Pronase. Further, radioactive peptides
      were isolated and purified after Pronase treatment and shown to contain
      glucosamine as well as a number of amino acids. 4. The experiments therefore
      indicate that d-[(14)C]glucosamine can be used as a specific precursor of the
      amino sugar units of plant as well as animal glycoproteins.

TI  - Glycoprotein of the wall of sycamore tissue-culture cells.
PG  - 953-61
AB  - 1. A glycoprotein containing a large amount of hydroxyproline is present in the
      cell walls of sycamore callus cells. This protein is insoluble and remained in
      the alpha-cellulose when a mild separation procedure was used to obtain the
      polysaccharide fractions of the wall. The glycoprotein contained a high
      proportion of arabinose and galactose. 2. Soluble glycopeptides were prepared
      from the alpha-cellulose fraction when peptide bonds were broken by
      hydrazinolysis. The soluble material was fractionated by gel filtration and one
      glycopeptide was further purified by electrophoresis; it had a composition of 10%
      hydroxyproline, 35% arabinose and 55% galactose, and each hydroxyproline residue 
      carried a glycosyl radical so that the oligosaccharides on the glycopeptide had
      an average degree of polymerization of 9. 3. The extraction of the glycopeptides 
      was achieved without cleavage of glycosyl bonds, so that the glycoprotein cannot 
      act as a covalent cross-link between the major polysaccharides of the wall. 4.
      The wall protein approximates in conformation to polyhydroxyproline and therefore
      it probably has similar physicochemical properties to polyhydroxyproline. This is
      discussed in relation to the function of the glycoprotein and its effect on the
      physical and chemical nature of the wall.

      of the polygalacturonases (polygalacturonide hydrolases, EC 3.2.1.15) secreted by
      the fungal plant pathogens Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, Fusarium oxysporum, and
      Sclerotium rolfsii. The inhibitor of the C. lindemuthianum polygalacturonase,
      purified 560-fold from bean hypocotyl extracts, is 40 times as effective an
      inhibitor of the C. lindemuthianum polygalacturonase as of the F. oxysporum
      polygalacturonase, and does not demonstrably inhibit the S. rolfsii
      polygalacturonase. A crude hypocotyl extract that completely inhibits the three
      polygalacturonases does not inhibit C. lindemuthianum-secreted cellulase,
      xylanase, alpha-galactosidase, alpha-arabinofuranosidase, or
      alpha-galacturonosidase. The purified bean hypocotyl protein combines with the C.
      lindemuthianum polygalacturonase to form a complex with a dissociation constant
      of 2 x 10(-9) M or less. The physical properties of these inhibitors are similar 
      to those of phytohemagglutinins and of the plant glycoproteins capable of
      agglutinating transformed animal cells.

TI  - Occurrence, Parasitism, and Pathogenicity of Nematodes Associated with Sycamore
      (Platanus occidentalis L.).
PG  - 189-96
AB  - Ten species of stylet-bearing nematodes were recovered in a survey of sycamore
      (Platanus occidentalis L. ) stands in Georgia. Helicotylenchus, Xiphinema, and
      Criconemoides were the genera found most frequently. Populations of Hoplolaimus
      galeatus, Scutellonema brachyurum, Helicotylenchus dihystera and H.
      pseudorobustus increased on greenhouse-grown sycamore, but Trichodorus christiei,
      Xiphinema americanum, Meloidogyne hapla, M. arenaria and M. incognita did not.
      Hoplolaimus galeatus and S. brachyurum are semi-endoparasites; H. dihystera and
      H. pseudorobustus are migratory endoparasites. Hoplolaimus galeatus caused
      extensive root necrosis and marked decrease of fresh weights of seedling roots
      and tops. Helicotylenchus dihystera and S. brachyurum produced only qualitatively
      different sparse and unhealthy root growth. Helicotylenchus pseudorobustus caused
      only a reduction in root surface area.

TI  - The characters of the symmetric group.
PG  - 399-401
AB  - A short and simple derivation of the formula of Frobenius, which gives the
      dimensions of the irreducible representations of S(n), the symmetric group on any
      number, n, of symbols, is given. These dimensions are the characters of the
      identity element of the group, i.e., of the element all of whose cycles are
      unary. It is shown how a slight modification of Frobenius' formula yields, when n
      = 2p is even, the characters of an element of S(n) all of whose cycles are binary
      and, when n = 3p is a multiple of 3, the characters of an element of S(n) all of 
      whose cycles are ternary and, generally, when n = kp is a multiple of any
      positive integer k, the characters of an element of S(n) all of whose cycles are 
      of length k. It is noteworthy that the calculations become simpler, rather than
      more complicated, as k increases. Finally, this paper shows how to derive from
      Frobenius' formula the characters of an element of S(n) which has at least one
      unary cycle and, from the present modifications of Frobenius' formula, the
      characters of an element of S(n) which has at least one cycle of length k, k = 2,
      3,..., n.

AB  - Plant cell walls contain a glycoprotein rich in hydroxyproline. To determine how 
      Acer pseudoplatanus L. cells transport this glycoprotein to the wall, the
      pulse-chase technique was used to follow changes in specific radio-activity of
      hydroxyproline and proline in isolated, mitochondrial, Golgi, microsomal, soluble
      protein, and wall fractions. The turnover rates or changes in specific
      radioactivity of cytoplasmic hydroxyproline in these cell fractions indicated
      that the bulk of this hydroxyproline was transferred not by the Golgi apparatus
      but by a smooth membranous component.

      Suspension-cultured Acer pseudoplatanus Cells.
PG  - 675-8
AB  - Several glycosidases have been isolated from suspensioncultured sycamore (Acer
      pseudoplatanus) cells. These include an alpha-galactosidase, an
      alpha-mannosidase, a beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, a beta-glucosidase, and two
      beta-galactosidases. The pH optimum of each of these enzymes was determined. The 
      pH optima, together with inhibition studies, suggest that each observed
      glycosidase activity represents a separate enzyme. Three of these enzymes,
      beta-glucosidase, alpha-galactosidase, and one of the beta-galactosidases, have
      been shown to be associated with the cell surface. The enzyme activities
      associated with the cell surface were shown to possess the ability to degrade to 
      a limited extent isolated sycamore cell walls. It was found that the activities
      of beta-glucosidase and of one of the beta-galactosidases increase as the cells
      go through a period of growth and decrease as cell growth ceases.

TI  - Metabolic relationships of the isolated fractions of the pectic substances of
      actively growing sycamore cells.
PG  - 45-59
AB  - 1. d-Glucose and l-arabinose serve as precursors of the pectic polysaccharides of
      sycamore suspension-callus tissue. 2. The rates and characteristics of the
      incorporation of radioactive sucrose, glucose and mesoinositol by sycamore callus
      tissue have been compared and shown to be different. 3. The time-course of the
      incorporation of radioactive glucose into the major fractions within the cells
      has been determined. Approx. 7-10% of the radioactivity incorporated is present
      in the whole pectin of the cells. 4. A study of the continuous incorporation of
      radioactive glucose showed that the neutral arabinan-galactan fraction of the
      pectin quickly became saturated with the radioactive label. During the
      incorporation of radioactivity from a pulse of radioactive glucose the neutral
      fraction became progressively less labelled, with a corresponding increase in the
      radioactivity of the weakly acidic pectinic acid, which is known to contain
      neutral sugars. 5. When the cells were exposed to a pulse of radioactive
      l-arabinose, the label accumulated first in the neutral fraction and then after
      4hr. it passed to the weakly acidic pectinic acid with a corresponding decrease
      in the radioactivity of the neutral fraction. 6. The product that was initially
      labelled during the first hour of exposure of the cells in the stationary phase
      to radioactive glucose was identified as an incompletely methylated galacturonan 
      in which the radioactivity was present in the anhydrogalacturonide residues. This
      polysaccharide probably acts as the precursor of the polyuronide portions of both
      the strongly acidic and weakly acidic pectinic acids. 7. The observations are
      discussed in relation to the structure of the pectic substances and their
      function in cell growth and development. A tentative model for their metabolic
      relationship is put forward.

TI  - The specific nature of plant cell wall polysaccharides.
PG  - 900-6
AB  - Polysaccharide compositions of cell walls were assessed by quantitative analyses 
      of the component sugars. Cell walls were hydrolyzed in 2 n trifluoroacetic acid
      and the liberated sugars reduced to their respective alditols. The alditols were 
      acetylated and the resulting alditol acetates separated by gas chromatography.
      Quantitative assay of the alditol acetates was accomplished by electronically
      integrating the detector output of the gas chromatograph. Myo-inositol,
      introduced into the sample prior to hydrolysis, served as an internal
      standard.The cell wall polysaccharide compositions of plant varieties within a
      given species are essentially identical. However, differences in the sugar
      composition were observed in cell walls prepared from different species of the
      same as well as of different genera. The fact that the wall compositions of
      different varieties of the same species are the same indicates that the
      biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharides is genetically regulated. The cell
      walls of various morphological parts (roots, hypocotyls, first internodes and
      primary leaves) of bean plants were each found to have a characteristic sugar
      composition.It was found that the cell wall sugar composition of
      suspension-cultured sycamore cells could be altered by growing the cells on
      different carbon sources. This demonstrates that the biosynthesis of cell wall
      polysaccharides can be manipulated without fatal consequences.

TI  - Pectic polysaccharides of growing plant tissues.
PG  - 194-204
AB  - 1. The polysaccharide compositions of the cell walls of sycamore cambium and
      sycamore callus tissue have been analysed and found to be directly comparable. 2.
      Electrophoretic analyses of the whole pectins prepared from actively growing
      callus and cambial tissue have shown that these preparations contain, in addition
      to the neutral and weakly acidic components present in apple fruit, a strongly
      acidic polygalacturonic acid component. 3. The weakly acidic component of all the
      pectins was directly comparable with that of the pectinic acid of apple fruit. 4.
      The components of the whole pectin of sycamore callus tissue have been partially 
      purified and analysed. The neutral and weakly acidic components also found in
      apple fruit were isolated. 5. The pattern of the composition of the neutral
      sugars present in the pectins of actively growing tissues of cambium and callus
      has been compared with those present in apple-fruit pectinic acid. 6. The
      presence of rhamnose linked as galacturonosyl-(1-->2)-rhamnose has been found in 
      sycamore whole pectin. 7. The difference in the pectins of callus, cambium and
      fruit appears not to be that of species difference but is more characteristic of 
      the nature of the growth and growth conditions of the cells. This is discussed in
      relation to the problems of the control and mechanism of plant-cell growth and
      differentiation.

TI  - Inositol Metabolism in Plants. III. Conversion of Myo-inositol-2-H to Cell Wall
      Polysaccharides in Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) Cell Culture.
PG  - 1489-98
AB  - Prolonged growth of cell cultures of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) on agar
      medium containing myo-inositol-2-(3)H resulted in incorporation of label
      predominately into uronosyl and pentosyl units of cell wall polysaccharides.
      Procedures normally used to distinguish between pectic substance and
      hemicellulose yielded carbohydrate-rich fractions with solubility characteristics
      ranging from pectic substance to hemicellulose yet the uronic acid and pentose
      composition of these fractions was decidedly pectic. Galacturonic acid was the
      only uronic acid present in each fraction. Subfractionation of alkali-soluble
      (hemicellulosic) polysaccharide by neutralization followed by ethanol
      precipitation gave 3 fractions, a water-insoluble, an ethanol-insoluble, and an
      ethanol-soluble fraction, each progressively poorer in galacturonic acid units
      and progressively richer in arabinose units; all relatively poor in xylose
      units.Apparently, processes involved in biosynthesis of primary cell wall
      continued to produce pectic substance during cell enlargement while processes
      leading to biosynthesis of typically secondary cell wall polysaccharide such as
      4-0-methyl glucuronoxylan were not activated.

TI  - Role of oxygen fixation in hydroxyproline biosynthesis by etiolated seedlings.
PG  - 197-202
AB  - Etiolated maize and soybean seedlings were grown for several days in atmospheres 
      enriched with O(18). Hydroxyproline subsequently isolated from the seedlings by
      column and thin-layer chromatography was labeled with excess O(18), but proline
      was not. Control experiments in which seedlings were grown in H(2)O(18) and
      unlabeled atmospheres demonstrated that neither proline nor hydroxyproline was
      labeled with excess O(18). It was concluded that oxygen fixation is an essential 
      feature of hydroxyproline biosynthesis in these seedlings, and that the hydroxyl 
      oxygen atom in hydroxyproline is derived from molecular oxygen and not from
      water; similar results have been reported previously for sycamore cell
      suspensions.

TI  - THE FINE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANION CELL OF THE PHLOEM OF ACER
      PSEUDOPLATANUS.
PG  - 117-28
AB  - At maturity the companion cell of the phloem of the sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus 
      has a large nucleus, simple plastids closely sheathed with rough endoplasmic
      reticulum, and numerous mitochondria. The cytoplasm contains numerous ribosomes, 
      resulting in a very electron-opaque cytoplasm after permanganate fixation. Bodies
      similar to the spherosomes of Frey-Wyssling et al. (4) are collected in clusters 
      and these also contain bodies of an unidentified nature similar to those found by
      Buttrose (1) in the aleurone cells of the wheat grain. The pores through the wall
      between the companion cell and sieve tube are complex and develop from a single
      plasmodesma. Eight to fifteen plasmodesmata on the companion cell side
      communicate individually with a cavity in the centre of the wall which is linked 
      to the sieve tube by a single pore about twice the diameter of an individual
      plasmodesma. This pore is lined with material of an electron opacity equivalent
      to that of material bounding the sieve plate pores. The development of the cell
      organelles, the possible role played in the phloem tissue by the companion cell, 
      and the function of the complex pores contained in its wall are discussed.

TI  - THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SECONDARY WALL OF THE XYLEM IN ACER PSEUDOPLATANUS.
PG  - 327-37
AB  - The development of the spirally thickened xylem element from a cambium initial of
      sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus has been traced by means of electron microscopy. The
      narrow elongated cambial initial undergoes considerable expansion in all
      dimensions. The cytoplasm at this stage is distributed in a thin skin between the
      cell wall and a large vacuole. No correlation has been observed between the
      distribution of any organelle and the pattern of the eventual thickenings. After 
      the sites of thickening deposition have become apparent, the most conspicuous
      feature of the cell is the proliferation of Golgi bodies and vesicles. It is
      suggested that the material of the developing thickenings stems from direct
      apposition of the material in the Golgi vesicles. After glutaraldehyde fixation, 
      microtubules (200 to 220 A in diameter) are seen to be sited in specific relation
      to the thickenings, the orientation of the tubules mirroring that of the fibrils 
      seen in the thickenings. Possible reasons for absence of an observable pattern in
      the expanded but relatively undifferentiated cell are given, and the possible
      roles of the Golgi apparatus and microtubules in the thickening production are
      discussed
