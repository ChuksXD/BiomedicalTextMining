TI  - Gadolinium-Labelled Aminoglycoside and its Potential Application as a
      Bacteria-Targeting Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agent.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful diagnostic technique that can
      penetrate deep into tissue providing excellent spatial resolution without the
      need for ionizing radiation or harmful radionuclides. However, diagnosing
      bacterial infections in vivo with clinical MRI is severely hampered by the lack
      of contrast agents with high relaxivity, targeting capabilities and bacte-rial
      penetration and specificity. Here, we report the development of the first
      gadolinium (Gd)-based bacteria-specific targeting MRI contrast agent, probe 1, by
      conjugating neomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, with Dotarem (Gd-DOTA, an FDA
      ap-proved T1-weighted MRI contrast agent). The T1 relaxivity of probe 1 was found
      to be comparable to that of Gd-DOTA; addi-tionally, probe 1-treated bacteria
      generated a significantly brighter T1-weighted MR signal than Gd-DOTA-treated
      bacteria. More importantly, in vitro cellular studies and preliminary in vivo MRI
      demonstrated probe 1 exhibits the ability to efficiently target bacteria over
      macrophage-like cells, indicating its great potential for high-resolution imaging
      of bacterial infections in vivo.
